Note:
Compared to other psychology studies, consider how the combination of sample size, p-value, effect size, statistical method complexity, first author citation count, and subfield influences replication likelihood. Provide a probability between 0 and 1 on the first line, then give a concise 2–3 sentence rationale that reflects this comparative judgment.",0.35,0.72,0.35,0.35,0.45,0.38,0.4333333333,"0.35
This prediction is low primarily due to the very small sample size (N≈14, as inferred from the F‑statistic's degrees of freedom), which creates low statistical power. Although the reported effect size is large, findings from underpowered studies are often inflated due to sampling error. The p‑value of 0.02 is also in a range known to have lower replicability, suggesting this specific result is not built on a robust statistical foundation.
---
0.72
This study reports a very large effect size (ηp² = 0.354) from a highly-controlled, within-subjects cognitive psychology experiment, and the high-citation author is an expert in the field. These factors strongly suggest the finding is robust and would replicate, despite a small sample size (N=24) and a p-value (0.02) that is only moderately strong. The combination of a large effect with a classic experimental paradigm makes a successful replication quite likely.
---
0.35
This study's predicted replicability is low due to weak statistical evidence. The most critical issue is the extremely small effective sample size (N ≈ 14) implied by the ANOVA's degrees of freedom, which raises concerns about statistical power. A p-value of 0.02 from such a small sample is not very robust, and the very large effect size is likely inflated due to sampling error, making this specific result difficult to replicate.
---
0.35
This prediction is low due to very weak statistical evidence, despite some positive contextual factors. The p-value of 0.02 is only slightly below the standard threshold for significance, and the test statistic's low denominator degrees of freedom (13) indicates the finding is based on a very small effective sample, increasing the chance of a false positive. Although the reported effect size is large and the author is highly cited, the statistical weakness suggests the effect may be overestimated and would be difficult to replicate.
---
0.45
The reported p-value of 0.02 is only marginally significant, which is a negative indicator for replicability. While the effect size is large, the small sample size (N=24) and especially the very low error degrees of freedom (df=13) suggest the study was underpowered. This makes the result statistically fragile and the large effect size likely an overestimation that would shrink in a replication attempt.
---
0.38
The probability is low due to a combination of weak statistical evidence. The sample size is very small (N=24, and possibly as low as N=14 for the key F-test given the degrees of freedom), and the reported p-value of 0.02 is close to the significance threshold, both of which decrease replication likelihood. While the reported effect size is large, such large effects in underpowered studies are often inflated and may not be reproducible, even if the high author citation count and cognitive subfield are positive indicators."

This prediction is high because the study reports a very large effect size (ηp² = .374) and a correspondingly low p-value (<.005), which are strong indicators of replicability. While the sample size of 24 is small, the use of a powerful within-subjects design for a core cognitive phenomenon partially mitigates this concern. The programmatic series of experiments described also suggests a methodologically and theoretically robust effect.

This study reports a very strong statistical result (p < .005, ηp² = .374), which on its own would suggest high replicability. However, this evidence is derived from a small sample (N=24), which increases the risk of effect size inflation and makes the result less stable. The use of a powerful within-subjects design mitigates this risk somewhat, and the strong signal suggests a true effect is likely present, leading to a moderately high chance of replication.

A high replication probability is predicted due to the very large reported effect size (ηp² = .374) and highly significant p-value (p < .005), which suggest a potent and reliable phenomenon. While the small sample size (N=24) introduces some uncertainty and risk of effect size inflation, the sheer magnitude of the effect observed in this within-subjects design makes it very likely to be detected again in a direct replication. The theory-driven, multi-experiment nature of the investigation further bolsters confidence in the finding.

The study reports a very strong effect (ηp² = .374) with a correspondingly low p-value (< .005), which are two of the strongest predictors of replication success. While the sample size (N=24) is small, this risk is substantially mitigated by the use of a powerful within-subjects (RM ANOVA) design. The programmatic series of six experiments, which systematically tests a clear hypothesis about participant strategy, further increases confidence in the robustness of the core finding.

This prediction is moderately high due to a very strong p-value (<.005) and a large effect size (ηp² = .374), suggesting a robust phenomenon. While the small sample size (N=24) is a significant concern that increases the risk of an overestimated effect, the systematic, multi-experiment approach detailed in the abstract lends credibility to the underlying theory. The study's foundation in cognitive psychology, a field with more controlled paradigms, also slightly increases the likelihood of a successful replication.
---
0.83
While the small sample size is a notable concern, several factors suggest a high likelihood of replication. The reported p-value is very low (<0.005) and the effect size is exceptionally large (ηp² = .374) for a powerful within-subjects design. Most importantly, the paper describes a programmatic series of experiments that systematically demonstrate the effect and its boundary conditions, indicating a robust and well-understood finding."

The low probability is primarily driven by the small sample size (N=25) and the marginal p-value, which is only slightly below the 0.05 significance threshold. This combination suggests the study had low statistical power, and the large reported effect size (ηp²=0.181) is likely inflated and may not be reproducible. Although the study is a controlled cognitive experiment, this weak statistical foundation makes a successful replication less likely.
---
0.35
This study's primary weakness is the combination of a small sample size (N=25) and a p-value that is close to the significance threshold of .05. Although the reported effect size is large, such estimates are often inflated in underpowered studies and may not be reliable. While the within-subjects cognitive paradigm is generally robust, the weak statistical evidence for this specific effect makes a successful replication less likely.
---
0.40
This study's replication likelihood is modest due to the combination of a small sample size (N=25) and a p‑value (≈0.03) that is close to the significance threshold. While the reported large effect size is a positive indicator, it is likely an overestimation given the small sample and marginal statistical significance. The use of a complex MANOVA analysis also allows for analytical flexibility that can reduce robustness.
---
0.38
This prediction is low due to several statistical weaknesses that undermine confidence in the finding. The sample size (N=25) is small, which increases the probability of an unstable and overestimated effect. Critically, the reported test statistic yields a p-value of approximately 0.03, which is close to the significance threshold and a strong negative predictor of replicability. The large effect size is likely an inflation artifact common in small, ""just-significant"" studies, and is less trustworthy than the other indicators.
---
0.45
While the study reports a large effect size and originates from cognitive psychology—a subfield with a comparatively better replication record—these positive factors are undermined by weaker evidence. The sample size is small (N=25), and the reported p‑value is just under the conventional threshold of significance (F(1, 24) = 5.29 corresponds to p ≈ 0.03). This combination suggests the result may be fragile and the effect size could be an overestimation, lowering the probability of a successful replication.
---
0.38
The probability is low primarily due to the small sample size (N=25) and a p-value (p≈0.03) that is barely below the standard significance threshold, both of which are strong predictors of replication failure. While the study is in cognitive psychology, a relatively high-replicability field, and reports a large effect size, this effect is likely inflated due to the low-powered design. Therefore, the weak statistical evidence substantially lowers the confidence in a successful replication."

This study has a high probability of successful replication due to its strong statistical evidence, including a very low p-value (<0.001) and a solid sample size (240). The controlled laboratory experiment in a classic cognitive paradigm also favors replicability. While the reported effect size is small-to-medium and the finding is described as surprising, the strength of the other indicators suggests the effect is likely robust.

The prediction is high due to the large sample size (N=240) and highly significant p‑value (p<0.001), which provide strong evidence for the effect. Although the effect size is only small-to-medium (η_p^2=0.052), the study is a well‑controlled laboratory experiment within a standard cognitive paradigm, a type of research that generally shows good replicability. These factors combined suggest a replication study is very likely to succeed.

Confidence is tempered slightly because the effect size is small-to-medium and the authors describe the finding as ""very surprising,"" factors which can be associated with lower replicability. However, the robust statistical foundation suggests the finding is more likely than not to be reproduced.

This study has a high probability of replication due to its large sample size (N=240) and very low p-value (p<0.001), which provide strong statistical evidence for the finding. While the effect size is small-to-medium (__p^2 = 0.052), the original study was well-powered to detect it, and the use of a standard experimental paradigm from cognitive psychology further increases confidence. The experienced author and straightforward analysis also contribute positively to this assessment.

This prediction is based on several strong statistical indicators, including a large sample size (N=240) and a highly significant p-value (p<.001), which increase confidence in the result. However, the effect size is only small-to-medium (ηp²=0.052), and the study's central claim is described as ""very surprising,"" a factor often associated with lower replication rates. While the statistical evidence is solid, the counterintuitive nature of the finding and the procedural complexity introduce some risk, leading to a moderately high but not certain prediction.

The prediction is high due to the strong statistical evidence: a large sample size (N=240) combined with a highly significant p-value (<0.001). While the cognitive psychology subfield and experienced author are positive indicators, the small-to-medium effect size (ηp²=0.052) and the surprising nature of the finding introduce some uncertainty. Overall, the robust statistical signals suggest the effect is likely real and replicable under similar conditions."

This study has a high probability of replication due to a combination of strong statistical evidence and a robust experimental design. The reported p-value is low (p≈.007, calculated from the F-statistic) and the effect size is medium (dz=0.51), suggesting a non-trivial underlying effect. The within-subjects design and standard analysis (RM ANOVA) are powerful and straightforward, and the sample size (N=32), while modest, provided good statistical power for an effect of this size.

This study has a high probability of replication due to several factors, despite its small sample size. The phenomenon is described as robust and the paper itself reports two internal replications, the p-value is solid (p≈.007, calculated from the F-statistic), and the powerful within-subjects design adds confidence. The primary risk is that the medium effect size (dz=0.51) might be an overestimation due to the small N=32 sample, but a true effect is still very likely to be present.
---
0.72
The reported test statistic is strong (p≈.007), and the medium effect size (dz=0.51) in a within-subjects design suggests a genuine effect. Confidence is further increased by the abstract describing the phenomenon as ""robust"" and reporting an internal replication. The main weakness is the small sample size (N=32), which introduces risk that the effect size is an overestimation, but the strength of the other signals makes replication more likely than not.
---
0.75
The prediction is moderately high due to the strong statistical evidence; the F-statistic corresponds to a p-value well below .01, which is a key predictor of replicability. Although the sample size (N=32) is small, this risk is partially offset by the within-subjects design, the plausible medium effect size (d=0.51), and the study's focus on a core cognitive psychology phenomenon. The experienced first author also provides a modest boost to this estimate.

This study has a high probability of replication due to several strong factors. The research investigates a well-established cognitive phenomenon, includes its own internal replications, and reports a statistically strong result (p < .01, calculated from the F-statistic). Although the sample size is modest (N=32), the plausible medium effect size (dz=0.51) and standard within-subjects design suggest the core finding is robust and would likely be observed again in an independent study.
---
0.72
The statistical evidence for this effect is fairly strong, with a p-value well below .01 (calculated from the F-statistic) and a medium effect size. While the sample size is small, the use of a within-subjects design (RM ANOVA) provides more statistical power than a between-subjects design with the same number of participants. The combination of a strong signal from a standard cognitive paradigm makes replication more likely than not, despite the small sample."

The very low p-value (0.002) and large reported effect size (dz = 0.724) are strong indicators of a robust finding. While the small sample size (N=24) is a significant weakness that can lead to unstable and overestimated results, the strength of the initial evidence is compelling. The use of a simple, standard analysis (t-test) further increases confidence that the effect is genuine and replicable.

The prediction is high due to the combination of a very strong p-value (p=0.002) and a large reported effect size (dz=0.724). Although the sample size is small (N=24), these metrics suggest a robust finding that is likely to replicate. This is further supported by the simple analysis type (t-test) and the cognitive psychology context, which often investigates reliable phenomena using powerful within-subjects designs.

0.78
This prediction is fairly high because the reported p-value is very low (0.002) and the effect size is medium-to-large (dz=0.724), suggesting a robust finding. While the small sample size (N=24) is a significant concern that increases the risk of an overestimated effect, the statistical analysis is a simple dependent t-test, which reduces concerns about analytical flexibility. Overall, the strength of the evidence outweighs the risk from the small sample.

The reported p-value is very low (0.002) and the effect size is large (dz = 0.724), both of which are strong positive predictors of replication success.

The reported p-value is very low (p=0.002) and the effect size is large (dz=0.724), both of which are strong positive indicators for replication. However, the small sample size of 24 is a significant concern, as findings from small samples can be less stable and produce inflated effect estimates. Despite this risk, the strength of the initial statistical evidence from a simple analysis suggests a high probability of a successful replication.

This study combines strong statistical evidence with a significant methodological weakness. The very low p-value (0.002) and large effect size (dz = 0.72) are strong predictors of replication success. However, the small sample size (N=24) is a major concern, as it leads to imprecise estimates and suggests the reported effect size may be inflated. The simple analysis (t-test) and cognitive subfield are minor positive factors, but the primary tension between the strong result and small sample makes a successful replication likely but not certain."

This study has a very high probability of successful replication. The reported effect size is extremely large (d = 1.02) and the statistical evidence is overwhelming (a t-statistic of 10.18 with 99 degrees of freedom implies a p-value far below .001). Furthermore, the study uses a simple analysis on an adequate sample size and seeks to model a foundational, robust finding from cognitive psychology, which increases confidence in the stability of the result.

This study has an extremely high likelihood of replication due to its very large effect size (d = 1.02) and correspondingly high test statistic, which imply a p-value far below the reported threshold. This strong statistical evidence, combined with a sufficient sample size and a simple, transparent analysis (t-test), points to a highly robust finding. As a computational modeling study of a well-established cognitive phenomenon, it is also less susceptible to the sampling noise that can hinder replication in novel behavioral experiments."

This study has a very high probability of replication due to its extremely strong statistical evidence: a very low p-value (p < .001) and a very large effect size (ηp² = .32).

This study shows very strong signals for successful replication, primarily due to the large effect size (ηp² = .32) and the highly significant p-value (p < .001). While the sample size of 39 is modest, it was more than adequate to detect such a strong effect, and the phenomenon of stereotype-driven memory distortion is a classic and robust finding in cognitive psychology. The straightforward ANOVA design further reduces concerns about analytical flexibility or complexity.

0.92
This study has a high likelihood of replication due to its very strong p-value (p<.001) and large effect size (ηp²=.32), which suggest a potent underlying effect. Although the sample size (N=39) is modest, the finding was demonstrated across three separate experiments in the original paper, a form of internal replication that greatly increases confidence. The effect itself, stereotype-based memory distortion, is also a well-established phenomenon in cognitive and social psychology.

This prediction is high due to the exceptionally strong statistical evidence, including a very low p‑value (<.001) and a large effect size (ηp² = .32). While the sample size is relatively small, such compelling results suggest a robust phenomenon that is very likely to replicate, especially since the core finding was demonstrated across three experiments in the original paper. The study investigates a well‑established concept in cognitive psychology, further increasing confidence.

0.88
The prediction is high because the study reports exceptionally strong evidence, including a very low p-value (<.001) and a large effect size (ηp² = .32). Although the sample size (N=39) is a limitation and might inflate the effect size estimate, the sheer statistical strength of the finding makes a successful replication very likely. The investigation of a classic cognitive bias using a standard ANOVA further increases confidence.

While the sample size is small, which can inflate effect size estimates, the statistical evidence for this well-established cognitive phenomenon is so compelling that a true, robust effect is highly probable. The use of a standard ANOVA adds to this confidence, as the analysis is straightforward and less prone to error."

This prediction is high due to the convergence of very strong evidence for the effect. The reported p-value is extremely low (<.001), and the effect size is exceptionally large (ηp² = 0.488), suggesting a robust phenomenon that is unlikely to be a false positive. Although the sample size is modest, an effect of this magnitude is highly likely to be detected again in a replication, and the finding comes from a standard experimental paradigm within cognitive psychology, a field whose core findings of this type tend to be reliable.

This prediction is high due to the extremely low p-value (p<.001) and the very large reported effect size (ηp² = 0.488), which signal a strong and clear finding. Although the sample size (N=32) is relatively small and could inflate the effect size estimate, the statistical evidence is so overwhelming that the underlying effect is almost certainly real and would be detected in a replication. The study's use of a standard cognitive paradigm for a plausible phenomenon also supports a high likelihood of success.

The prediction is high due to the very strong statistical evidence, including an extremely low p-value (< .001) and a very large effect size (ηp² = 0.488). Although the sample size (N=32) is small, the sheer magnitude of the effect suggests it is robust and likely to be found again. Furthermore, studies on core cognitive processes, such as this one, have demonstrated higher replication rates than studies in some other subfields of psychology.

This prediction is high due to the extremely strong statistical evidence; the p-value is very low (<.001) and the effect size is exceptionally large (ηp² = 0.488). While the sample size is modest, an effect of this magnitude is highly robust and easily detectable, making it very likely to replicate successfully. The study's focus on a fundamental cognitive process using a standard experimental paradigm further increases confidence in the finding.

This study has a very high probability of successful replication. The reported p-value is highly significant (p<.001), and the effect size is exceptionally large (ηp² = 0.488), indicating a very robust phenomenon. While the sample size (N=32) is modest, the strong effect means the study was likely well-powered, and the finding—a cognitive processing effect from a controlled lab experiment—is a type that generally replicates well.
---
0.92
The very low p-value (<.001) and massive effect size (__p^2 = 0.488) are strong predictors of replication success. While the sample size of 32 is modest, the study uses a within-subjects design to test a core cognitive process (numerical interference), a type of finding that is generally robust. The combination of a huge effect and a standard paradigm makes a successful replication highly probable."

The study reports a very low p-value (<.001) and a massive effect size (ηp² = .452), which would normally suggest a high probability of replication. However, the extremely small sample size (N=22) makes it highly likely that the effect size is overestimated and raises concerns about the stability of the finding. While the finding comes from cognitive psychology, which tends to replicate better, the weak sample provides a poor foundation for such a strong claim, making a successful replication moderately likely but far from certain.

The prediction is high due to the extremely strong statistical evidence, including a very low p-value (<.001), a large F-statistic, and a very large effect size (ηp² = .452). While the sample size of 22 is a significant weakness and suggests the effect size may be inflated, the use of a powerful within-subjects design (RM ANOVA) somewhat mitigates this concern. An effect this statistically pronounced, even in a small sample, is very likely to be real and thus successfully replicate.

The study’s reported p-value is extremely close to the .05 significance threshold, which is a strong predictor of replication failure. This marginal result, combined with a relatively small sample size for a mixed ANOVA design, suggests the original study may have been underpowered and the medium effect size could be an overestimation. Finding a specific interaction effect, which is often less robust than a main effect, further lowers the confidence in its replicability.
---
0.35
The primary reason for the low prediction is the p-value, which is just below the .05 threshold and is a strong negative predictor of replicability. Furthermore, the key finding is a specific interaction effect, which is often less robust than a main effect. Although the sample size (N=48) and reported medium effect size are decent for a within-subjects design, they are outweighed by the weak statistical evidence.
---
0.35
The reported p-value is just under the .05 threshold, which is a strong predictor of replication failure, especially when combined with a relatively small sample size (N=48). This marginal result suggests the reported medium effect size may be an overestimate and that the finding, an interaction from a complex mixed ANOVA, may not be robust. While based on a standard cognitive paradigm, the statistical evidence for this specific effect is weak.
---
0.35
The primary concern is the p-value; the reported F(2, 92) = 3.13 corresponds to an actual p-value of approximately .049, which is perilously close to the .05 threshold and a strong indicator of low replicability. While the medium effect size (d = .52) and theory-driven nature of the interaction are positive signs, the modest sample size (N=48) provides low statistical power for detecting a potentially fragile interaction effect. The combination of a borderline-significant result from a relatively small sample substantially lowers the probability of a successful replication.
---
0.42
The primary concern is the reported p-value, which at <.05 for an F-statistic of 3.13 is very close to the significance threshold (p≈.048), a strong negative predictor of replicability. This, combined with a modest sample size (N=48) for a mixed ANOVA, suggests the study may have been underpowered and the reported medium effect size is likely an overestimation. While the cognitive psychology paradigm is well-established, such borderline significant results for interaction effects are often difficult to reproduce.
---
0.35
The primary reason for the low replication estimate is the reported p-value, which is just below the .05 threshold (the F-statistic corresponds to p=.048); such ""barely significant"" results are known to replicate poorly. This concern is compounded by the modest sample size of 48 for a mixed ANOVA design, suggesting the study might be underpowered and the reported medium effect size could be an overestimation. While the topic is in cognitive psychology, which often involves more controlled experiments, the weak statistical evidence is the overriding factor."

This study is highly likely to replicate due to the extremely strong statistical evidence, including a very low p-value (<.001) and a massive effect size (ηp² = 0.550). While the sample size of 36 is small, which is a notable weakness, an effect this large is very powerful and should be readily detectable even in a replication with a modest sample. The finding stems from the subfield of cognitive psychology, where experimental effects on basic processes are often robust.
---
0.92
The prediction is very high due to the exceptionally large reported effect size (partial η² = 0.55) and the correspondingly strong statistical evidence (F(2, 68) = 41.59, p < .001), which suggest a very robust phenomenon. Although the sample size is modest and the finding is a complex interaction, an effect of this magnitude is highly likely to replicate successfully. The experienced first author and the cognitive psychology subfield, which often uses powerful within-subject designs, add to this confidence.
---
0.82
The reported effect size is extremely large (ηp² = 0.550) with a very low p‑value (<.001), suggesting a powerful and robust finding that is likely to replicate. While the sample size is small (N=36) and the analysis is complex (mixed ANOVA), which are typically risk factors, the sheer magnitude of the effect makes it highly probable that an independent study would detect it. The study’s focus on a core cognitive process further increases confidence in its replicability.

The study reports an extremely large effect size (partial η² = 0.550) and a correspondingly low p-value (p < .001), which are strong positive predictors of replication success. While the sample size is small (N=36), which can inflate effect size estimates, an effect of this magnitude is likely to be detected even in a replication with a modest sample. The high author citation count and the cognitive psychology subfield, which often involves more controlled experiments, also lend confidence to the finding.

The primary reason is the exceptionally large reported effect size (partial η² = 0.55) and the correspondingly low p-value (< .001), which suggest a very strong and robust phenomenon. While small samples can produce inflated effect sizes, an effect this massive is very likely real and would be detectable even in a replication with modest power.

The prediction is high due to the exceptionally strong statistical evidence; the reported p-value is very low (<.001) and the effect size is very large (ηp^2 = 0.55). While the sample size of 36 is small, such a powerful effect is highly likely to be detectable and not merely a result of sampling error. The study's foundation in cognitive psychology, a subfield with historically higher replication rates, further supports this high probability."

Note:
Compared to other psychology studies, consider how the combination of sample size, p-value, effect size, statistical method complexity, first author citation count, and subfield influences replication likelihood. Provide a probability between 0 and 1 on the first line, then give a concise 2–3 sentence rationale that reflects this comparative judgment.",0.4,0.25,0.35,0.3,0.45,0.25,0.3333333333,"0.40
The primary reason for this low prediction is the combination of a p‑value (p=0.028) that is very close to the .05 significance threshold and a small reported effect size (d=0.198). Studies with barely significant p‑values for small effects have low statistical power and are less likely to replicate successfully, as the original finding may be a slight overestimation of the true effect. Although the sample size is reasonable for a within‑subjects cognitive task and the analysis is simple, these positive factors are outweighed by the weak statistical evidence for the effect.
---
0.25
The reported p-value of 0.028 is suspiciously close to the significance threshold and appears to result from a one-tailed test, as the t-statistic corresponds to a two-tailed p-value of approximately .056. This marginal evidence, combined with a small effect size (d = 0.198), suggests the finding is not robust. Studies with small effects and p-values just under .05 have a low probability of successful replication.
---
0.35
The primary reasons for this low prediction are the reported p-value (0.028), which is very close to the conventional significance threshold, and the small effect size (d = 0.198). While the sample size is adequate and the statistical analysis is simple, these positive factors are generally outweighed by the weak statistical evidence for the effect. Studies with marginally significant p-values for small effects have a high probability of being false positives or overestimated effects, making successful replication unlikely.
---
0.30
The primary drivers for this low estimate are the small effect size (d = 0.198) and a p-value (0.028) that is very close to the conventional significance threshold. Such marginal results are often statistically underpowered and have a lower probability of replicating, especially since the finding would not have been significant with a two-tailed test (p ≈ .056). While the sample size is reasonable, it is not large enough to lend strong confidence to a small and barely-significant effect.
---
0.45
The study's reported p-value of 0.028 is statistically significant but very close to the conventional .05 threshold, which is associated with a lower probability of replication. This concern is amplified by the small effect size (d = 0.198), as small effects are inherently less robust and require large samples to detect reliably. While the sample size is moderate and the analysis is straightforward, the weak statistical evidence presents a substantial challenge to successful replication.
---
0.25
The reported p-value is just below the conventional threshold and, based on the t-statistic, likely required a one-tailed test to achieve significance, suggesting the result is fragile. This statistical weakness is compounded by a small effect size (d = 0.198), indicating the original study was underpowered to reliably detect such an effect. Although the sample size and analysis simplicity are favorable, the combination of a borderline p-value and a small effect strongly predicts a low probability of successful replication."

The very low p‑value (<.001) and large reported effect size (ηp² = 0.186) are strong predictors of a successful replication, particularly for a controlled cognitive experiment. However, the small sample size (N=39) is a major weakness, introducing uncertainty and the possibility that the effect size is inflated. The strength of the initial evidence suggests the effect is likely real, but its magnitude may be smaller, leading to a moderately high probability of replication.
---
0.68
The reported p-value is very low (<.001) and the effect size is large (ηp²=0.186), which are strong positive indicators for replication. However, the small sample size of 39 is a major concern, as findings from underpowered studies can be unstable and effect sizes can be inflated. The use of a standard within-subjects ANOVA for a computer-based task is a positive factor, but the small sample remains the primary source of uncertainty.
---

The prediction is high primarily due to the very strong statistical evidence: a p‑value below .001 and a large reported effect size (ηp² = 0.186). Although the sample size of 39 is small, this risk is partially offset by the use of a powerful repeated-measures design and the fact that the paradigm is a controlled cognitive experiment. The finding is therefore quite likely to be robust.

This prediction balances very strong statistical evidence against a significant methodological weakness. The extremely low p‑value (<.001) and large effect size (ηp² = 0.186) are strong positive predictors of replication. However, the small sample size (N=39) is a major concern, as such studies are prone to overestimating effect sizes (the ""winner's curse""). Nevertheless, the statistical signal is so strong that the effect is likely real, and a well‑powered replication would probably succeed in detecting it.

This prediction is moderately high due to several strong positive indicators, including a very small p‑value (<.001) and a large effect size (ηp² = 0.186), which suggest a robust phenomenon. The high citation count of the first author and the presence of two experiments in the original paper further increase confidence. However, the primary concern is the very small sample size (N=39), which can lead to overestimated effects and less stable results, tempering the overall replication likelihood.

This study has a very high probability of replication due to its extremely strong statistical evidence, including a very low p-value (<.001) and a large, internally consistent effect size (ηp^2 = 0.186). While the sample size is small, this weakness is mitigated by the high statistical power of the repeated-measures ANOVA design. The controlled, lab-based cognitive nature of the task also strongly favors successful replication."

This study has a very high probability of replication due to the extremely low p-value (<.001) and the very large reported effect size (ηp² = .31).

The study reports very strong evidence, including a large effect size (ηp² = .31) and a highly significant p-value (<.001), which are primary indicators of replicability. Although the sample size is modest, the within-subjects design provides substantial statistical power for an effect of this magnitude. Furthermore, the paper reports three experiments with consistent findings, which serves as a robust internal replication and greatly increases the likelihood of a successful independent replication.

The prediction is moderate-to-low due to competing factors. While the sample size (N=96) is adequate for a lab study and the cognitive subfield generally has higher replication rates, the statistical evidence for the key finding is weak. The reported p‑value is close to the .05 threshold, and the small effect size (η²=.05) indicates that the finding may not be robust, making it difficult to detect again in a direct replication.
---
0.35
The prediction is low primarily because the p-value is just under the .05 significance threshold, a factor strongly associated with lower rates of replication success. Furthermore, the key finding is a statistical interaction with a relatively small effect size (η²=.05), and such effects are often less robust and harder to replicate than simple main effects. While the sample size is adequate for a lab study, these statistical indicators suggest the finding may be fragile.
---
0.55
The prediction is moderate due to mixed signals in the study's metrics. While the sample size of 96 is adequate for a controlled cognitive experiment, the statistical evidence is not robust; the reported p-value is close to the conventional .05 threshold and the effect size (η²=.05) is small. This combination suggests that the statistical power to detect the effect is modest, giving an independent replication a substantial chance of failure.

The probability of replication is modest primarily because the reported p-value (<.05) is close to the significance threshold and the effect size (η²=.05) is small-to-medium, both of which are associated with lower replication rates. Although the sample size (N=96) is adequate, the statistics for this specific interaction effect suggest the original study had only moderate power. The fact that the key effect was observed in only one of three experiments further suggests it may be fragile or highly context-dependent.

The prediction is moderate-to-low primarily because the reported p-value is just under the .05 threshold (p=.028), which is a strong statistical predictor of lower replicability. Although the sample size is reasonable and the cognitive subfield has a better-than-average replication history, the key finding is an interaction with a small-to-medium effect size (η²=.05), which can be less robust than a simple main effect.

The primary concern for replication is the weak statistical evidence; a p-value just under the .05 threshold (p≈.028) combined with a small-to-medium effect size (ηp²=.05) suggests the finding may not be robust. This risk is partially offset by a respectable sample size for a mixed-design study and a strong theoretical grounding within the cognitive psychology subfield, where findings are often more replicable. The key result being an interaction also adds a layer of complexity that can slightly lower replication probability."

Compared to other psychology studies, consider how the combination of sample size, p-value, effect size, statistical method complexity, first author citation count, and subfield influences replication likelihood.

The primary reason for the low replication probability is the extremely small sample size (N=18), which yields low statistical power and makes findings highly unstable. Although the reported p-value is very low, such a significant result from a severely underpowered study is often a large overestimation of the true effect, if one exists at all. Furthermore, the abstract notes the existing literature on this topic is ""equivocal,"" suggesting that findings in this specific subfield are already known to be difficult to reproduce consistently.

0.15
The primary reason for the low replication estimate is the extremely small sample size (N=18), which is inadequate for producing stable and reliable results in a between-groups comparison. Although the p-value is low, findings from underpowered studies are often driven by inflated effect sizes that do not replicate. Additionally, the research area concerning a ""bilingual advantage"" is known for its equivocal and often contradictory findings, making any single result less likely to be reproduced consistently.
---
0.15
The primary reason for the low replication probability is the extremely small sample size (N=18), which suggests the study is underpowered and the significant p-value is likely a result of an overestimated effect. Furthermore, there is a critical inconsistency between the reported sample size and the F-statistic's degrees of freedom, which raises concerns about reporting accuracy or analytical choices. The research area itself—the cognitive effects of bilingualism—is also known for having mixed and difficult-to-replicate findings.
---
0.20
The primary reason for the low replication probability is the extremely small sample size (N=18), which provides low statistical power and suggests the reported effect is likely inflated. Although the p-value is low, such strong results from underpowered studies often fail to replicate, and the complex pattern of interactions described is inherently more difficult to reproduce than a simple main effect. Additionally, there is an inconsistency between the reported sample size and the F-statistic’s degrees of freedom (df=93), which raises concerns about reporting accuracy.
---
0.20
The prediction is low primarily due to the extremely small sample size (N=18), which is insufficient for stable estimates and suggests the study is severely underpowered. While the p‑value is low, with such a small sample it likely reflects a highly inflated effect estimate that would not be found in a larger, more robust replication. The complex, interactive nature of the hypothesis also poses a greater replication challenge than a simple main effect.
---
0.3
The primary weakness of this study is its extremely small sample size (N=18), which makes it severely underpowered and the results likely unstable. While the p-value is low, significant findings from underpowered studies are often substantial overestimates of the true effect and have a lower probability of replicating. Furthermore, the ""bilingual advantage"" is a notoriously contentious area of research with many mixed findings, suggesting a lower prior probability of success for any given study."

The reported p-value is very low (<.001) and the F‑statistic is large, implying a substantial and statistically robust effect that is less likely to be a chance finding. This strong signal, combined with a solid sample size (N=154) for a within-subjects cognitive experiment, suggests a high likelihood of successful replication. While priming effects can sometimes be sensitive to procedural details, the strength of the original evidence is a powerful positive indicator.

The reported statistical evidence is very strong, with a large F-statistic and a p-value < .001, suggesting a robust effect that is unlikely to be a false positive. The sample size of 154 is also quite adequate for a repeated-measures ANOVA design, lending further credibility to the finding. While the effect relies on a specific priming paradigm, its statistical strength and the author's high citation count suggest the original study was well-conducted and a replication is highly likely to succeed.

This study has a high likelihood of replication due to several strong statistical indicators. The p-value is very low (<.001), the F-statistic is large (F(1, 152) = 23.176), and the sample size (N=154) is substantial for a within-subjects cognitive experiment. These factors combine to suggest a robust and large effect that is likely to be observed again in a direct replication.

This study has a high probability of successful replication due to its very strong statistical evidence, including a p-value <.001 and a large F-statistic that implies a medium-to-large effect size. The finding is further bolstered by a solid sample size for a cognitive experiment using a standard within-subjects ANOVA. While priming effects can be subtle, the highly significant result from an established author suggests a robust phenomenon.

This study has a very high probability of replication due to its extremely strong statistical evidence, including a low p‑value (p < .001) and a large F‑statistic that implies a substantial effect size. The respectable sample size for a within-subjects cognitive experiment further increases confidence that the finding is stable and not a statistical artifact. The well‑controlled lab-based design and standard analysis also support a high likelihood of a successful replication.

The probability is high due to multiple strong indicators, including a very low p-value (<.001), a large F-statistic, and a correspondingly large implied effect size.

Despite the very small sample size, the reported p-value is extremely low and the effect size is very large. The study investigates a plausible nuance of the Hebb repetition effect, a famously robust finding in cognitive psychology that is typically studied with powerful within-subjects designs. These strong positive signals suggest a high likelihood of replication, even if the true effect size is smaller than what was reported here.

0.88
This prediction is high due to the extremely large reported effect size (d = 1.51) and very low p‑value (<.001), which signal a strong and statistically robust finding. While the sample size is small (N=24), this is a common characteristic of cognitive psychology experiments that use powerful within‑subjects designs where each participant provides many data points. The study builds on a well‑established, frequently replicated phenomenon (the Hebb effect), making the novel finding a plausible extension rather than a surprising outlier.

The reported p-value is extremely low (<.001) and the effect size is very large (d=1.51), both of which are strong positive predictors of replication success.

The reported p-value is very low (<.001) and the effect size is large, both of which strongly predict replication success. Although the sample size (N=24) is small, which can inflate effect size estimates and reduce stability, the study builds upon the Hebb repetition effect, a well-established and robust finding in cognitive psychology.

The prediction is moderately high due to the combination of a very strong p-value (<.001) and a very large effect size (d = 1.51), which suggest a robust finding. This is counterbalanced by the very small sample size (N=24), which is a significant risk factor for replicability and may have inflated the reported effect size. However, the study's foundation in cognitive psychology and on a well-established phenomenon (the Hebb effect) lends it additional credibility, making a successful replication likely.

0.85
The prediction is high due to the very strong evidence (p < .001, large effect size d = 1.51) for an extension of a known, robust cognitive phenomenon. While the sample size (N=24) is small, which is a major concern for replicability, the sheer strength of the reported statistics makes a false positive unlikely. A successful replication is therefore probable, even if the resulting effect size is smaller than the original estimate."

The key finding reported was not statistically significant (p > 0.1), making a successful replication (defined as p < .05) highly improbable by definition. This conclusion is strongly reinforced by the study's very small sample size (N=16) and small reported effect size (η² = .026), which indicate low statistical power and an unstable estimate of the effect. Therefore, the most likely outcome of a replication is another non-significant result.
---
0.08
The original study reported a non-significant p-value (>0.1), which is the strongest indicator that a replication attempt will also fail to find a significant effect. This is exacerbated by a very small sample size (N=16) and a small effect size (η²=.026), suggesting the original experiment was severely underpowered and the result is unstable. These factors combined make a successful replication (defined as achieving p < .05) extremely unlikely.

0.35
This study has a very low probability of replication success. The primary reason is the extremely small sample size (N=16), which makes the study severely underpowered and its findings unstable. While the reported p-value is non-significant, which can sometimes be easier to replicate, the study's low power means this null result is not informative and could easily be a Type II error. A better-powered replication study could plausibly find a different outcome.
---
0.1
The predicted probability of success is extremely low primarily because the original study failed to find a statistically significant effect (p > 0.1). This null result was found with a very small sample (N = 16) and a small effect size (η² = .026), meaning the study was underpowered and its estimate is unreliable. A replication is therefore most likely to confirm the original null finding rather than achieve a significant result.
---
0.08
The primary reason for the very low replication probability is that the original study reported a non-significant result (p > 0.1), providing no statistical evidence for the effect. This finding, combined with a very small sample size (N=16) and a correspondingly small effect size (η² = .026), indicates the study was severely underpowered. Consequently, it is highly unlikely that an independent replication would achieve statistical significance.

In contrast, when the utility of familiarity was undermined by using pseudohomophones, additivity was observed in the means but not in distributional characteristics. Specifically, opposing interactive effects in the underlying distribution were observed, producing apparent additivity in means.

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
The joint effects of stimulus quality and word frequency in lexical decision were examined in 4 experiments as a function of nonword type (legal nonwords, e.g., BRONE, vs. pseudohomophones, e.g., BRANE). When familiarity was a viable dimension for word-nonword discrimination, as when legal nonwords were used, additive effects of stimulus quality and word frequency were observed in both means and distributional characteristics of the response-time distributions. In contrast, when the utility of familiarity was undermined by using pseudohomophones, additivity was observed in the means but not in distributional characteristics. Specifically, opposing interactive effects in the underlying distribution were observed, producing apparent additivity in means. These findings are consistent with the suggestion that, when familiarity is deemphasized in lexical decision, cascaded processing between letter and word levels is in play, whereas, when familiarity is a viable dimension for word-nonword discrimination, processing is discrete.

This prediction is low primarily due to the small sample size (N=32) and a p-value (p=0.03) that is close to the significance threshold of 0.05. These factors increase the likelihood that the original result was a false positive or that its large reported effect size is an overestimation. Although the study uses a powerful within-subjects design common in cognitive psychology, the marginal statistical evidence is a strong indicator of low replicability.
---
0.45
The small sample size (N=32) and a p‑value (0.03) that is just below the significance threshold are strong indicators of a fragile effect that may not replicate. While the reported effect size is large (ηp² = .143) and the within‑subjects design offers good statistical power, findings from small samples with marginal p‑values are often inflated and susceptible to sampling error. Therefore, a successful independent replication is somewhat unlikely.
---
0.45
This prediction is based on the combination of a small sample size (N=32) and a p‑value (p=0.03) that is only just below the standard significance threshold. While the reported effect size is large, such estimates are often inflated in small studies, a phenomenon known as the ""winner's curse."" Although the study is in cognitive psychology, a field with comparatively higher replication rates, the weak statistical evidence for this specific finding makes a successful replication less likely.
---
0.45
The primary concern for replication is the p-value of 0.03, which is close to the significance threshold and indicates relatively weak evidence. Although the reported effect size is large, such estimates are often inflated in small samples (N=32), a phenomenon known as the ""winner's curse."" While the experienced author and within-subjects design are positive signs, the combination of a small sample and a borderline p-value significantly lowers the probability of a successful replication.
---
0.40
The prediction is below 0.5 primarily due to the combination of a small sample size (N=32) and a p‑value (p=0.03) that is only just below the conventional significance threshold. While the reported effect size is large and the study is in cognitive psychology—a subfield with historically higher replication rates—such borderline p‑values are often associated with overestimated effects and lower replicability. The statistical power for a direct replication is likely modest, making a successful outcome uncertain despite the robust experimental paradigm.
---
0.62
This prediction balances strong but competing indicators. The p-value of 0.03 is very close to the conventional 0.05 threshold and the sample size is small, both of which are negative predictors of replication success. However, the study reports a large effect size (__p^2 = .143) and uses a powerful within-subjects design in cognitive psychology, a subfield with a comparatively high replication rate for this type of research."

The probability of successful replication is low primarily because the original finding was not statistically significant by conventional standards (p < .06). Such ""marginally significant"" results are highly susceptible to sampling error and are often difficult to replicate, as a new sample could easily yield a non-significant p-value. While the reported effect size is large, it is likely an overestimation given the marginal p-value and the modest sample size, which suggests the original study was underpowered.
---
0.15
The reported p-value of <.06 is the strongest indicator of a low replication probability, as the original study did not achieve statistical significance at the conventional p<.05 level. While the reported effect size is large, the small sample size of 32 suggests this estimate is likely inflated and that the study was underpowered. A direct replication of a non-significant finding is very unlikely to yield a significant result.
---
0.15
The primary reason for the low replication probability is the reported p-value of < .06, which indicates a “marginally significant” result that is highly susceptible to being a false positive. This issue is compounded by a small sample size (N=32), which provides low statistical power and suggests the reported large effect size is likely inflated. These factors combined indicate the finding is statistically fragile and unlikely to be reproduced in a new experiment.
---
0.15
The primary reason for the low predicted success is that the original study's p-value of < .06 is not statistically significant at the conventional alpha level of .05, making the initial evidence for the effect very weak. This marginal result, combined with a small sample size (N=32), suggests the study was underpowered and the observed effect is likely unreliable or overestimated. The complexity of testing for an interaction also reduces the probability of a successful replication.
---
0.15
The primary predictor of failure is the reported p-value of <.06, which is not statistically significant by conventional standards and represents very weak evidence for the effect. This issue is compounded by the small sample size, which means the study was likely underpowered and the large reported effect size is an imprecise and probably inflated estimate. While the within-subjects cognitive paradigm is a point in its favor, this is insufficient to overcome the extremely fragile statistical evidence for the original finding.
---
0.25
The likelihood of replication is low primarily because the key finding was not statistically significant by conventional standards (p < .06), which is a strong negative predictor. This borderline result, combined with a small sample size (N=32), suggests the study had low statistical power and that the large reported effect size is likely an overestimation.

Note:
Compared to other psychology studies, consider how the combination of sample size, p-value, effect size, statistical method complexity, first author citation count, and subfield influences replication likelihood. Provide a probability between 0 and 1 on the first line, then give a concise 2–3 sentence rationale that reflects this comparative judgment.",0.2,0.15,0.25,0.3,0.15,0.4,0.2416666667,"0.20
The probability of replication is very low due to several major risk factors. The extremely small sample size (N=8) provides very little statistical power and produces an unstable effect estimate. Furthermore, the reported p-value (p=0.023) is close to the conventional significance threshold, and findings from small studies that are ""barely significant"" are less likely to replicate.
---
0.15
The likelihood of replication is very low, primarily due to the extremely small sample size (N=8), which offers low statistical power and an unreliable effect estimate. This concern is amplified by a p-value (0.023) that is only barely significant and a major internal inconsistency between the reported t-statistic and the effect size (η_p²), which suggests potential errors in the original analysis or reporting. While the author is well-established, these statistical weaknesses make the finding highly suspect.
---
0.25
This prediction is low primarily due to the combination of an extremely small sample size (N=8) and a p-value (p=0.023) that is close to the significance threshold of .05. Studies with such low statistical power are susceptible to false positive results and tend to have inflated effect size estimates, making them difficult to replicate successfully. While the simple t-test analysis is a positive sign, it does not overcome the profound weakness of the statistical evidence.
---
0.30
The primary reason for the low replication probability is the extremely small sample size (N=8), which provides very low statistical power and produces highly unreliable effect estimates. Although the implied effect size is large, this is likely an overestimation, and the reported p-value of 0.023 is not robust enough to be convincing with such a small sample. While the senior author is well-established, the severe statistical weakness makes a successful replication unlikely.
---
0.15
The primary reason for this low prediction is the extremely small sample size (N=8), which provides very low statistical power and yields fragile results. This issue is compounded by a p‑value (0.023) that is only marginally significant and a major inconsistency between the reported test statistic and the effect size. These factors combined strongly suggest the original finding has a high probability of being a false positive and is unlikely to replicate.
---
0.40
The predicted probability is low primarily due to the extremely small sample size (n=8) and a p-value (0.023) that is just below the significance threshold, a combination that suggests the result may be a false positive or that the effect size is substantially inflated. While the simple analysis and cognitive psychology subfield are positive signs, the statistical evidence is too weak to inspire high confidence. A well-powered replication would likely find a much smaller effect, if any."

This study has a very high probability of replication due to its extremely large effect size and correspondingly low p-value. While the sample size is small, the use of a powerful within-subjects design (RM ANOVA) means the reported effect is strong and less susceptible to individual noise. The controlled, experimental nature of the cognitive task also contributes to a higher likelihood of successful replication.

The study reports an extremely large effect size (ηp² = .427) and a highly significant p-value (<.001), which are strong positive indicators for replication. Although the sample size is small, the use of a powerful repeated-measures design for a core cognitive psychology topic makes it very likely that the effect is robust. A successful replication is highly probable, even if the observed effect size is somewhat smaller.

This prediction is high primarily due to the combination of a very significant p-value (<.001) and an extremely large effect size (ηp² = .427), which strongly indicate a robust phenomenon. While the sample size of 37 is modest, the statistical power of the within-subjects design (RM ANOVA) and the sheer magnitude of the effect make it very likely to replicate. Such clear and strong evidence is less likely to be the result of a statistical artifact or sampling error.

0.85
The prediction is high due to the extremely low p-value (p < .001) and very large effect size (ηp² = .427), both of which are strong predictors of replication success. Although the sample size (N=37) is small, which can inflate effect size estimates, the use of a powerful within‑subjects design and the overwhelming statistical evidence suggest the finding is robust. The first author's experience, implied by their citation count, also adds modest confidence.

Although the sample size (N=37) is small, the use of a within-subjects design and the sheer magnitude of the reported effect make it very likely that an independent replication would also find a significant result. The straightforward analysis (RM ANOVA) and theory-testing nature of the study further increase confidence.

The probability of replication is high despite the small sample size. This is because the reported statistics indicate an exceptionally strong result, with a very low p-value (<.001) and a large effect size (ηp² = .427). Furthermore, the study's use of a powerful within-subjects design in cognitive psychology, a subfield that often tests robust phenomena, increases confidence in the finding's stability."

This prediction is high due to the very strong p‑value (0.001) and a medium‑to‑large effect size (d=0.6), which are powerful indicators of replicability. The simple paired t‑test analysis and within‑subjects experimental design increase confidence in the result, providing statistical power despite the modest sample size of 40.

The strong statistical evidence, including a very small p-value (p=0.001) and a medium-to-large effect size (d=0.6), suggests a robust finding. This is further supported by the use of a simple paired t-test in a cognitive psychology paradigm, a combination that tends to produce more replicable results.

A successful replication is highly probable due to the extremely large reported effect size (ηp² = .51) and very low p-value (<.01). While the small sample size of 24 is a significant concern and suggests the true effect may be smaller, the original statistical evidence is so strong that a replication is still very likely to detect a significant effect. The controlled, cognitive nature of the experiment and the established author also slightly increase confidence in the finding.

While the small sample size (N=24) is a major weakness and suggests the effect size may be inflated, the sheer strength of the evidence and the fact it is based on five separate experiments make a successful replication likely. A replication would almost certainly find a smaller effect, but the original finding is strong enough that the effect would likely remain significant.

0.72
This study has a high likelihood of replication success due to its very strong statistical evidence (p<.01, ηp²=.51), which suggests a robust underlying phenomenon that is unlikely to be a statistical fluke. However, the primary weakness is the very small sample size (N=24), which means the enormous effect size is likely overestimated and would be smaller in a replication attempt. The study's focus on a core cognitive process, which often involves more controlled experimental designs, provides additional confidence in its replicability.
---
0.68
The reported p-value is strong (p<.01) and the effect size is extremely large (ηp² = .51), which both favor successful replication. However, the very small sample size (N=24) is a significant weakness, as it can produce unstable and inflated effect size estimates. While the true effect is likely smaller than reported, the original signal is so strong that a well-powered replication would probably still detect a significant effect.

The study shows a very strong statistical signal, with a very large effect size (ηp² = .51) and a low p‑value (p<.01). While the small sample size (N=24) is a concern as it can lead to inflated effect estimates, this is strongly counteracted by the fact that the authors reported a series of five experiments. This internal replication provides compelling evidence for the robustness of the effect, making a successful independent replication highly likely.

The very low p-value (<.01) and large effect size (ηp^2 = .51) suggest a robust finding, and studies in cognitive psychology tend to replicate well. While the small sample size (N=24) is a significant weakness that can lead to inflated effect estimates, the sheer strength of the reported signal makes a successful replication likely. A replication with adequate statistical power would likely find a smaller, but still significant, effect."

Compared to other psychology studies, consider how the combination of sample size, p-value, effect size, statistical method complexity, first author citation count, and subfield influences replication likelihood. Provide a probability between 0 and 1 on the first line, then give a concise 2–3 sentence rationale that reflects this comparative judgment.",0.15,0.25,0.2,0.25,0.3,0.25,0.2333333333,"0.15
This prediction is low due to the combination of an extremely small sample size (N=12) and a p-value on the borderline of the significance threshold (the reported F-statistic yields p ≈ .051). Such findings are highly susceptible to sampling error, and the large effect size is likely an overestimation common in underpowered studies. A direct replication is therefore very unlikely to produce a statistically significant result.
---
0.25
The primary predictors of replication failure here are the extremely small sample size (N=12) and the p-value being just barely below the .05 threshold. This combination suggests the result is statistically fragile and may be a false positive, as small, underpowered studies require much stronger evidence (i.e., smaller p-values) to be convincing. While the reported effect size is large, it is likely an overestimation due to the low power, and an independent replication would probably find a much smaller, non-significant effect.
---
0.20
This study has a very high risk of replication failure due to its extremely small sample size (N=12), which provides low statistical power and unstable estimates. Furthermore, the reported F‑statistic corresponds to a p‑value of .051, which contradicts the reported p < .05 and suggests the original finding is statistically fragile and right on the decision boundary. The large effect size is likely an overestimation common in underpowered studies, making a successful replication highly improbable.
---
0.25
The study has a very low probability of replication due to its extremely small sample size (N=12), which makes it severely underpowered. A p-value just under the .05 threshold combined with a very large effect size (ηp² = .30) in such a small sample is a classic indicator of an unstable, likely inflated finding. While the author is established, the statistical properties of the key result suggest it would not be robust to a replication attempt.
---
0.3
The primary reasons for the low predicted replication success are the extremely small sample size (N=12) and the p-value being just below the .05 threshold, both of which are strong indicators of an unreliable result. Although the reported effect size is large, it is likely highly inflated due to the low statistical power of the original study. The weakness of this statistical evidence makes a successful replication unlikely, despite the study's plausible hypothesis within cognitive psychology.
---
0.25
The replication probability is low primarily due to the extremely small sample size (N=12) and a p-value that is just at the threshold for significance. While the reported effect size is large and the cognitive psychology subfield tends to have higher replication rates, the weak statistical evidence from this underpowered study makes the finding likely to be a high-variance, inflated estimate. A well-powered replication is therefore unlikely to find a statistically significant result."

The prediction is below 0.5 due to the small sample size (N=68) and a complex, unusual statistical analysis, which can make findings less stable and more susceptible to error. While the reported test statistic (z=3.10) is strong and would normally suggest high replicability, its robustness is questionable in the context of a small sample. The lack of a reported effect size and the vague p-value notation are also negative indicators for replication success.
---
0.50
While the reported test statistic is strong (z=3.10, p≈.002), several factors raise concerns. The sample size (N=68) is small for a complex correlational design, increasing the risk of an unstable or overestimated effect. Furthermore, key details like the exact p-value and an effect size are missing, and the complexity of the Bayesian model and contrast test could pose challenges for a direct replication.
---
0.42
The prediction is below 0.5 primarily due to the small sample size (N=68), which provides low statistical power and increases the risk of an overestimated effect. Additionally, the complex and unusual statistical method—a test of contrast of correlated correlations—introduces analytical flexibility that can hinder direct replication. While the reported test statistic is strong (z=3.10), this is often insufficient to overcome the challenges posed by a small sample in a study with a complex modeling framework.
---
0.45
The prediction is below 50% due to several risk factors for replication failure. The sample size (N=68) is small, and the statistical analysis—a test of contrast on four correlated correlations—is highly complex, increasing the potential for analytical flexibility and errors. Most importantly, reporting a p‑value of ""<.05"" for a strong test statistic (z=3.10, which implies p≈.002) is a significant red flag for questionable research practices, which is strongly associated with lower replication rates.
---
0.45
The reported p-value is very strong (z=3.10 corresponds to p≈.002), which is a positive sign for replicability. However, this is counteracted by a small sample size (N=68), which can produce unstable and inflated effect estimates. Furthermore, the complex analysis (a contrast of four correlated correlations) and modeling paradigm may be sensitive to subtle procedural differences, increasing the difficulty of a successful direct replication.
---
0.35
The reported test statistic is strong (z=3.10 corresponds to p≈.002), which is a positive indicator. However, this is heavily counteracted by the small sample size (N=68) and a highly complex, non-standard statistical method (a test of contrast of 4 correlated correlations). Such complexity, combined with a small sample, increases the risk that the finding is a statistical artifact or the result of undisclosed researcher degrees of freedom, thus lowering replication likelihood."

The primary concern for replicability is the small sample size (N=67). Although the p-value is low and the reported effect size is very large (ηp² = 0.241), such large effects found in small samples are often inflated. A replication study would likely find a substantially smaller, and potentially non-significant, effect, especially given that complex social psychology findings can be sensitive to context.
---
0.45
This prediction is cautious due to the small sample size (N=67), which increases the risk that the result is a statistical artifact or that the effect size is substantially overestimated. While the reported effect size (ηp² = 0.241) is very large and the p-value is low, findings from small samples can be less stable. Moreover, studies in social psychology focusing on complex interactions have historically shown moderate replication rates due to their sensitivity to subtle contextual factors.
---
0.65
The study reports a strong signal with a low p‑value (<.01) and a very large effect size (ηp²=0.241), which are positive indicators for replicability. However, this finding comes from a small sample (N=67), which is a significant concern as it can lead to inflated effect size estimates and results that are less stable. The social psychology context, involving a complex interpersonal scenario, also introduces uncertainty, as such effects can be sensitive to subtle procedural variations.
---
0.35
The prediction is low primarily due to the small sample size (N=67), which increases the likelihood that the reported very large effect size (partial ηp² = 0.241) is inflated. While the p‑value is strong (<.01), findings from small-sample studies are often difficult to reproduce, especially for social psychology topics that rely on inducing a specific psychological state. A well‑powered replication would likely find a much smaller and potentially non‑significant effect.
---
0.62
This study's very low p-value (<.01) and large effect size (ηp²=0.241) are strong predictors of a successful replication. However, this confidence is tempered by the small sample size (N=67), which increases the risk of an overestimated effect size, and by the social psychology subfield, where effects can be sensitive to subtle contextual factors that are difficult to reproduce. Overall, the statistical evidence is robust enough to suggest the effect is real, even if its magnitude might be smaller upon replication.
---
0.75
The very low p-value (p<.01) and large effect size (ηp^2 = 0.241) strongly suggest a robust finding. While the sample size of 67 is a limitation and may have led to an overestimation of the true effect, the signal is powerful enough that a well-powered replication is likely to succeed. The simple ANOVA analysis and the fact that the abstract describes a series of four studies further increase confidence in the replicability of the core phenomenon."

The prediction is moderately high due to the strong p-value (p<.01), which is well below the conventional threshold for significance. However, this confidence is tempered by the small sample size (N=70) and a corresponding small-to-medium effect size (R^2=.09), which could be overestimated. The fact that the finding was reported across four studies in the original paper significantly increases its credibility and chances of replication.

This prediction is based on the strong statistical evidence; the p-value is low (<.01) and the t‑statistic (3.08) is well above the conventional threshold for significance. The moderate sample size (N=70) provides adequate power to detect an effect of this magnitude (an implied partial correlation of r ≈ .35), which increases confidence in the stability of the finding. Furthermore, the abstract describes a series of four studies investigating a plausible methodological mechanism, suggesting the effect has already been internally replicated and is likely robust.

The prediction is based on a strong p-value (p<.01) and a respectable medium effect size (R²=.09), which suggest a robust finding. While the sample size of 70 is only moderate and the hierarchical regression analysis introduces some analytical flexibility, the highly significant test statistic and the experienced author's programmatic, multi-study approach increase confidence in the result's replicability.
---
0.68
The reported p‑value is strong (p < .01) and the finding is supported by four internal studies, which are positive indicators for replication success. However, the relatively small sample size (N=70) for a hierarchical regression is a significant weakness, as it can produce imprecise and inflated effect size estimates. The experienced author provides some confidence, but the limited sample introduces notable uncertainty.
---
0.45
The primary concern is the small sample size (N=70), which provides low statistical power for a hierarchical regression and increases the risk of an overestimated effect size. While the finding comes from a 4‑study paper by an established author, the reported p‑value (p<.01) is not overwhelmingly strong and the study is in social psychology, a subfield with historically lower replication rates. A replication with a larger sample would likely find a smaller effect, which may not reach statistical significance.

0.55
The primary concern is the small sample size (N=70) for a regression analysis, which can lead to an unstable and potentially overestimated effect size. While the reported p-value is strong (p<.01), such findings from low-powered studies can be difficult to replicate, as the true effect may be smaller than what was observed. The experienced author is a positive sign, but the statistical weakness of the small-N design makes the outcome of a replication uncertain."

At younger ages within this range, there were large individual differences in acquiescent responding, and acquiescence variability had pronounced effects on psychometric characteristics. Beyond the effects of acquiescence, self-reports generally became more coherent within domains, and better differentiated across domains, at older ages.

To identify the year-by-year timing of developmental trends from late childhood (age 10) to early adulthood (age 20), the authors examined Big Five self-report data from a large and diverse Internet sample. At younger ages within this range, there were large individual differences in acquiescent responding, and acquiescence variability had pronounced effects on psychometric characteristics. Beyond the effects of acquiescence, self-reports generally became more coherent within domains, and better differentiated across domains, at older ages. Importantly, however, different Big Five domains showed different developmental trends. Extraversion showed especially pronounced age gains in coherence but no gains in differentiation. In contrast, Agreeableness and Conscientiousness showed large age gains in differentiation but only trivial gains in coherence. Neuroticism and Openness showed moderate gains in both coherence and differentiation. Comparisons of items that were relatively easy versus difficult to comprehend indicated that these patterns were not simply due to verbal comprehension. These findings have important implications for the study of personality characteristics and other psychological attributes in childhood and adolescence.

Note:
Compared to other psychology studies, consider how the combination of sample size, p-value, effect size, statistical method complexity, first author citation count, and subfield influences replication likelihood. Provide a probability between 0 and 1 on the first line, then give a concise 2–3 sentence rationale that reflects this comparative judgment.",0.95,0.95,0.95,0.92,0.92,0.95,0.94,"0.95
The prediction is very high primarily due to the massive sample size, which ensures that the findings are statistically stable and the estimates are precise. The extremely large F‑statistic and corresponding p‑value, while expected with such a large N, confirm that the detected effects are not due to sampling error. Descriptive findings on developmental trends in large-scale datasets are generally robust and more likely to replicate than findings from small, experimental studies.
---
0.95
The likelihood of successful replication is extremely high, primarily due to the massive sample size (N > 230,000) and the correspondingly strong statistical evidence (a very large F-statistic with p < .001). The finding itself—that personality score variance differs across adolescent age groups—is a plausible developmental effect, and the statistical test provided directly assesses this. While an effect size is not reported, the overwhelming statistical power makes it very probable that an independent replication would also find a significant effect.
---
0.95
The prediction for high replicability rests almost entirely on the massive sample size (N > 230,000) and the correspondingly large test statistic (F=118.15). This provides extremely high statistical power, ensuring that the finding is not a fluke and that the effect, even if small in magnitude, is estimated with great precision. A direct replication with a similarly large sample is almost certain to find a statistically significant result in the same direction.
---
0.92
The extremely large sample size provides immense statistical power, yielding a highly significant p-value and a very robust F-statistic. This suggests the detected difference in variance is not a product of sampling error and is very likely to be found again in a replication. While the lack of a reported effect size is a limitation, the sheer weight of the statistical evidence makes a successful replication, in terms of achieving statistical significance, highly probable.
---
0.92
This prediction is high primarily due to the massive sample size, which provides highly stable and precise estimates of the effects. The reported test statistic is extremely significant, and the research describes fundamental, plausible developmental trends rather than a surprising or counter-intuitive effect that might be prone to failing replication. Although the specific effect size is missing and the overall analysis is complex, the sheer statistical power and the foundational nature of the research question suggest a high likelihood of a successful replication.
---
0.95
The primary reason for the high replication probability is the study's massive sample size (N > 230,000), which yields extremely high statistical power and a very precise estimate of the effect. This, combined with the highly significant p-value (p < .001) and large F-statistic, makes it overwhelmingly likely that the reported finding is not a statistical artifact due to sampling error. Although the effect size may be small, a well-powered replication is almost certain to again find a statistically significant result."

The primary concerns are the reported p-value (p=0.03), which is just below the conventional significance threshold, and the modest sample size for what is likely a small true effect. Findings with ""barely significant"" p‑values are less likely to replicate, as the original result may be a false positive or a substantial overestimation of the effect. Additionally, social psychology studies involving subtle manipulations like mortality salience have historically shown lower replication rates due to their sensitivity to context.
---
0.22
The reported p-value of 0.03 is only marginally significant, a range that is highly associated with replication failures. More critically, the reported effect size is mathematically inconsistent with the provided test statistic and degrees of freedom, which raises concerns about the result’s robustness. While the sample size is moderate, the study is in a subfield (social psychology) and concerns a topic (terror management) where effects have often proven difficult to replicate.
---
0.35
This prediction is primarily driven by the p-value of 0.03, which is only slightly below the conventional threshold for significance and is associated with lower replication rates. The study's subfield, social psychology, has also faced broad replication challenges, particularly for phenomena related to priming and terror management theory. While the sample size of 100 is not extremely small and the statistical analysis is straightforward, these positive factors are outweighed by the weak signal of the original evidence.
---
0.35
The primary concern is the p-value of 0.03, which provides only weak statistical evidence and is a strong predictor of replication failure. This weak evidence, combined with a moderate sample size for a likely small-to-medium effect, suggests the result is not robust. While the author is established and the analysis is simple, these factors do not outweigh the low evidential value of the original test statistic.
---
0.35
The reported p-value of 0.03 is very close to the conventional significance threshold, a factor strongly associated with lower replication rates. While the sample size of 100 is not extremely small, it provides limited statistical power for the calculated small-to-medium effect size, increasing the chance the original finding was overestimated. Furthermore, the study is in social psychology, a subfield whose priming-based findings have historically shown lower-than-average replicability.
---
0.35
The reported p-value of 0.03 is only marginally significant, and findings in this p-value range are known to have a low rate of successful replication. Additionally, the study is in social psychology and uses a subtle experimental manipulation (mortality salience), a combination that has historically faced reproducibility challenges. The major inconsistency between the reported test statistic and the very large reported effect size also reduces confidence in the finding's robustness."

The prediction is low due to a combination of risk factors. The sample size (N=36) is small, which increases the chance of a false positive and inflates the observed effect size. Moreover, the p-value (p=0.02) is close to the significance threshold of .05, a range that has been associated with lower replication rates. The study's topic, social priming, is also a subfield that has historically faced significant replication challenges.

0.15
This prediction is low due to the combination of a very small sample size (N=36) and a p‑value (0.02) that is close to the significance threshold of 0.05. Such studies are often underpowered, leading to inflated effect sizes and a higher probability of being false positives. Additionally, the study's topic of broad behavioral priming falls into a subfield of social psychology that has historically suffered from low replication rates.
---
0.15
This study has a very high risk of non-replication due to its small sample size (N=36) and a p-value (p=0.02) that is only slightly below the conventional significance threshold. Such underpowered studies are prone to finding inflated effect sizes, and the reported large effect (ηp^2 = 0.143) is unlikely to be reproduced in a higher-powered replication. The study's topic, social priming, is also a subfield known for significant replication failures.

0.15
This study has a very low probability of replication due to its small sample size (N=36) and a p-value (0.02) that is close to the significance threshold, both of which are strong indicators of a fragile result. The reported effect size is implausibly large for a subtle priming manipulation, suggesting a high likelihood of a ""winner's curse"" or publication bias. Furthermore, the subfield of broad behavioral priming has a well-documented history of replication failures.

0.25
This study has several characteristics associated with a low probability of replication. The small sample size (N=36) provides low statistical power and is prone to finding inflated effect sizes, while the p-value of 0.02 is not highly compelling. Most importantly, the study's topic—social priming—belongs to a subfield with a well-documented history of major replication failures, making the reported large effect unlikely to be reproduced in a new, independent sample.

0.22
The predicted probability is low due to a combination of high-risk factors. The study's very small sample size (N=36) provides low statistical power, and the p-value (p=.02) is close to the conventional significance threshold, both of which are strongly associated with lower replicability. Furthermore, the study concerns social priming, a subfield with a well-documented history of replication failures, and the large reported effect size is likely an inflation characteristic of an underpowered study."

This prediction is low primarily because the study investigates a social priming effect, a type of finding that has a notoriously poor replication record. The reported p‑value of 0.02 is statistically significant but is not very strong, suggesting the original result may have been a false positive or that the true effect size is much smaller than what was found. While the sample size is moderate, the questionable nature of the underlying phenomenon and the marginal p-value are strong indicators that a direct replication attempt would be unlikely to succeed.

This study's focus on social priming, a subfield with a known history of replication failures, is a major concern. The reported p-value of 0.02 is only narrowly significant and falls within a range often associated with lower replicability.

This study's focus on social priming—a subfield known for a high rate of replication failure—is a major concern. The reported p-value of 0.02 is not highly significant and falls within a range where results are more likely to be false positives. While the reported effect size is medium, it is likely inflated given the modest sample size, and a precise replication would probably fail to find a statistically significant result.

This prediction is low primarily because the study describes a social priming effect, a subfield with a well-documented history of failed replications. Furthermore, the reported p-value of 0.02 is only weakly significant and falls into a range that has been shown to be less likely to replicate successfully. While the author is well-cited and the analysis is simple, these factors are insufficient to overcome the high risk associated with the study's paradigm and marginal statistical evidence.

This study's p-value of 0.02 is close to the conventional significance threshold, which is a strong negative predictor of replicability.

While the reported effect size is medium, this is likely an overestimate given the modest sample size and p-value.

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
In five studies, the authors examined the effects on cognitive performance of coherence and incoherence between conceptual and experiential sources of affective information. The studies crossed the priming of happy and sad concepts with affective experiences. In different experiments, these included approach or avoidance actions, happy or sad feelings, and happy or sad expressive behaviors. In all studies, coherence between affective concepts and affective experiences led to better recall of a story than did affective incoherence. The authors suggest that the experience of such experiential affective cues serves as evidence of the appropriateness of affective concepts that come to mind. The results suggest that affective coherence has epistemic benefits and that incoherence is costly in terms of cognitive performance.

This prediction is low due to several risk factors. The reported p-value (<.02) is statistically significant but falls within a range that has shown lower replicability than more stringent p-values. Furthermore, the partial eta-squared effect size is small (ηp² ≈ .04), suggesting the finding may not be robust and would require a high-powered replication to detect. While the sample size is moderate, the study's subfield (social cognition) has historically faced challenges with replication, particularly for subtle experimental manipulations.
---

The strongest predictor of success is the internal replication across five studies, which suggests the effect is not a statistical fluke. However, this optimism is tempered by the reported effect size, which is quite small (η² ≈ .04), and a p‑value that is significant but not highly convincing (p < .02). Small effects are inherently more difficult to replicate as they require large, high-powered samples to detect reliably, leading to a moderate chance of success for any single replication attempt.
---
0.7
The most compelling evidence for replicability is the report of five separate studies all demonstrating the same core effect. While the reported effect size is small (ηp² ≈ .04) and the p-value is not exceptionally low (p < .02), this consistency across an internal replication series suggests the finding is robust. The moderate sample size and standard analysis (RM ANOVA) further support a reasonably high likelihood of a successful replication.
---
0.65
The finding's consistency across five experiments is a strong positive signal, suggesting the effect is not a statistical artifact. However, the p-value is modest (<.02) and the effect size is small (η² ≈ .04), which are risk factors for non-replication. Balancing these factors, the strong internal replication provides moderate confidence that a new, well-powered study would also find a significant result.
---
0.40
This prediction is driven by two key metrics: a p-value that is just under the conventional .05 threshold and a small effect size (ηp² ≈ .04). This combination is often associated with a higher risk of replication failure, as the original result may have been a slight overestimation of a fragile effect. While the sample size is adequate, the subtle nature of the social-cognitive manipulation may be sensitive to contextual differences between labs, further lowering the probability of a successful replication.
---
0.65
This prediction balances positive and negative indicators. On the positive side, the study uses a respectable sample size for its within-subjects design, and the existence of five converging studies in the paper suggests the authors established internal robustness. However, the reported p-value (<.02) is not far from the .05 threshold, and the effect size is small-to-medium (calculated ηp² ≈ .04), two factors that are known to lower the probability of successful replication."

The study’s low probability of replication is primarily driven by its small sample size (N=48, with even lower degrees of freedom) and a p-value (0.03) that is only barely below the threshold for significance. Although the reported effect size is large, such estimates are often inflated in small, underpowered studies. Furthermore, the use of complex methods like event-related potentials (ERP) in social cognitive neuroscience introduces many potential points of failure in a direct replication attempt.

The prediction is low due to the combination of a p-value (0.03) that is just below the significance threshold and a small sample size (N=48, df=31). Such findings are often statistically underpowered, may have inflated effect sizes, and have a lower probability of successful replication. The study's complexity, involving an interaction between self-reported motivation and neural (ERP) data, could also introduce methodological challenges that hinder reproducibility.
---
0.25
The prediction is low due to several statistical red flags. The study has a small sample size and a p‑value of .03, a combination that is strongly associated with replication failure. Additionally, the use of a mixed ANOVA on complex ERP data provides considerable researcher flexibility, which can lead to findings that are difficult to reproduce, while the large effect size is likely an overestimation given the small sample.

0.35
The prediction is low due to a small sample size and a p-value of .03, which is only slightly below the typical significance threshold, making the result susceptible to sampling error. While the reported effect size is large, effects found in small-N studies are often inflated and may shrink considerably in a higher-powered replication. These statistical weaknesses, combined with the methodological complexity of an ERP study, outweigh the positive indicator of the author's high citation count.
---
0.35
This study has a high risk of non-replication due to its small sample size and a p-value just below the significance threshold. Such a combination suggests the finding is not robust and the large reported effect size is likely inflated. The study's subfield, social psychology, has also historically demonstrated lower replication rates, which further tempers confidence in this specific result.
---
0.25
The probability is low due to the combination of a very small sample size (N=33 for the key F-test) and a p-value (p=.03) that is just below the conventional threshold for significance. This indicates the study was underpowered, which substantially increases the chance of a false positive and suggests the large reported effect size is likely inflated. Although the lead author is well-established, these core statistical weaknesses are strong predictors of replication failure."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
The action-based model of dissonance predicts that following decisional commitment, approach-oriented motivational processes occur to assist in translating the decision into effective and unconflicted behavior. Therefore, the modulation of these approach-oriented processes should affect the degree to which individuals change their attitudes to be more consistent with the decisional commitment (spreading of alternatives). Experiment 1 demonstrated that a neurofeedback-induced decrease in relative left frontal cortical activation, which has been implicated in approach motivational processes, caused a reduction in spreading of alternatives. Experiment 2 manipulated an action-oriented mindset following a decision and demonstrated that the action-oriented mindset caused increased activation in the left frontal cortical region as well as increased spreading of alternatives. Discussion focuses on how this integration of neuroscience and dissonance theory benefits both parent literatures.

Compared to other psychology studies, consider how the combination of sample size, p-value, effect size, statistical method complexity, first author citation count, and subfield influences replication likelihood.

The prediction is low primarily because the reported p-value is just under the .05 significance threshold (the test statistic yields an exact p-value of .049), which is a strong statistical predictor of replication failure. While the moderate sample size and medium-to-large effect size are positive indicators, this statistical fragility is a major concern. Additionally, the complexity of combining a neurofeedback manipulation, a psychological mindset, and behavioral outcomes increases the difficulty of a successful direct replication.
---

The reported p-value of <.05 is borderline significant, as the test statistic F(2, 54) = 3.19 corresponds to a p-value of approximately 0.048, a range associated with lower replication rates. While the effect size is moderate-to-large and the author is highly cited, the complexity of the neurofeedback paradigm and the borderline p-value suggest a substantial risk of replication failure. The relatively small sample size may have also led to an inflated effect size estimate.
---
0.35
The primary reason for this prediction is the reported p-value, which is just below the .05 significance threshold, indicating a statistically fragile result that could easily fail to replicate. While the reported effect size (ηp² = 0.11) is medium-to-large, such estimates are often inflated in studies with moderate sample sizes (N=57) and marginal p-values. The complex neurofeedback paradigm and repeated-measures analysis also introduce procedural and analytical flexibility that can pose challenges for a direct replication.
---
0.38
The primary reason for this prediction is the reported p-value, which is just barely below the conventional α = .05 threshold (an F‑statistic of this magnitude yields p ≈ .049), as such borderline results often fail to replicate. While the reported effect size is medium-to-large and the sample size is adequate for a within-subjects design, the study's methodological complexity, particularly the use of neurofeedback, introduces procedural variables that can be difficult to reproduce precisely. The combination of a fragile p‑value and a complex experimental paradigm suggests a lower-than-average probability of successful replication.
---
0.35
The primary predictor of low replicability is the p-value being just under the .05 threshold, which suggests the finding may not be robust. Although the reported effect size is medium-to-large, it is likely an overestimation given the borderline statistical significance and moderate sample size. Furthermore, the study combines social psychology—a field with historically lower replication rates—with complex neurofeedback methods that can be difficult to implement consistently across labs.
---
0.25
The reported p-value is extremely close to the .05 threshold, which is a strong negative predictor of replicability, especially when combined with a modest sample size of 57. While the effect size is medium-to-large and the author is well-established, the statistical result appears fragile. Furthermore, the complexity of combining neurofeedback with a social psychology paradigm introduces many potential hidden moderators that could make a direct replication difficult."

The sample size of 103 is adequate for a lab experiment designed to detect a strong signal, and the use of a standard ANOVA analysis adds confidence.

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
The authors present a model positing that when people are insecure about a relationship partner's acceptance, they often express emotional vulnerabilities to the partner, which causes them to believe the partner views them as highly vulnerable and insecure. In turn, this belief causes them to doubt the authenticity of the partner's expressions of positive regard, which may perpetuate the experience and expression of insecurity that initiated the process. Prototypes of interactions with interpersonally vulnerable individuals included partners' inauthentic expressions of regard (Study 1). Suggesting that these prototypes are applied to personal relationships when vulnerabilities are expressed, those who claimed to have expressed vulnerabilities doubted the partner's authenticity because they believed that they were viewed as vulnerable (Studies 2A, 2B, and 4). Authenticity doubts in turn predicted perceptions of rejection (Studies 3 and 4), which in turn predicted partner derogation and subsequent expressions of vulnerability (Study 4). An experimental manipulation of reflected appraisals of vulnerability increased doubts about the authenticity of a new acquaintance's expressions of emotion (Study 5). Relational insecurity may be perpetuated via the intrapersonal cognitive consequences of expressing it.

The prediction is low due to the combination of a small effect size (__p^2 = 0.028) and a p-value (<.05) that is close to the significance threshold of .05. While the sample size of 186 is reasonable, such small effects are inherently less stable and more difficult to detect consistently, often requiring larger samples for a high-powered replication. The complex, multi-step nature of the social-cognitive theory may also make the finding less robust across different contexts.
---
0.25
The prediction is low primarily due to the combination of a p-value just below the .05 threshold and a small reported effect size (ηp² = 0.028). Such ""just significant"" findings for small effects have a lower probability of successful replication, as the original result may be a consequence of sampling error or a slight overestimation of the true effect. While the sample size is moderate, it may lack sufficient statistical power to reliably detect this small effect in a direct replication attempt.
---
0.35
This prediction is low due to the combination of a p‑value very close to the .05 significance threshold and a small reported effect size (ηp² = 0.028). Findings with these characteristics are more likely to be statistically fragile or have inflated effect sizes, giving them a lower probability of successful replication. The moderate sample size is not large enough to overcome the uncertainty associated with this small, marginally significant effect.

The prediction is low primarily due to the combination of a small effect size (ηp² = 0.028) and a p‑value that is close to the significance threshold of .05. While the sample size of 186 is moderate, such ""just significant"" findings for small effects are often the result of an overestimation in the original study, making them difficult to reproduce. The complexity of the social-cognitive model presented may also pose challenges for a successful replication.

0.35
The probability of replication is low primarily due to the small reported effect size (ηp² = 0.028), which would require a very large sample to detect reliably. While the p-value is below .05, it is not overwhelmingly strong, and the study's complex multi-step model in social psychology—a subfield with historically lower replication rates—presents multiple potential points of failure. The moderate sample size is a positive factor but is likely insufficient to overcome the weakness of the effect.

The reported p-value is close to the .05 significance threshold and the effect size is small (ηp² = 0.028), two factors strongly associated with lower replication rates. While the sample size of 186 is reasonable, the study investigates a complex, multi-step social-cognitive model, a type of finding that can be fragile and difficult to reproduce. The combination of weak statistical evidence and theoretical complexity suggests a modest probability of successful replication."

The prediction for high replicability is driven by the overwhelmingly strong statistical evidence: a very low p‑value (<.001) and an exceptionally large effect size (R² = .68). An effect of this magnitude is very likely to be detected again, and the moderate sample size of 153 provides sufficient power for such a finding.

The reported p‑value is very small (p < .001) and the effect size is exceptionally large (R² = .68), which are both strong positive predictors of replicability.

This prediction is high due to the combination of a very strong p-value (<.001) and an exceptionally large reported effect size (R² = .68), which suggest a powerful and statistically robust finding. Even if the true effect is smaller, the decent sample size (N=153) provides good statistical power, making a successful replication highly probable. The fact that the original paper presented five studies demonstrating the effect across different contexts further strengthens confidence in the core phenomenon.

The extremely low p-value (p<.001) and very large reported effect size (R²=.68) are strong positive predictors of replication. Furthermore, the original paper reported a series of five converging studies, lending confidence to the core finding. Although the effect size may be somewhat inflated and the subfield of social psychology has faced replication challenges, the statistical evidence from this specific study is exceptionally strong.

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
The experience of mixed emotions increases with age. Socioemotional selectivity theory suggests that mixed emotions are associated with shifting time horizons. Theoretically, perceived constraints on future time increase appreciation for life, which, in turn, elicits positive emotions such as happiness. Yet, the very same temporal constraints heighten awareness that these positive experiences come to an end, thus yielding mixed emotional states. In 2 studies, the authors examined the link between the awareness of anticipated endings and mixed emotional experience. In Study 1, participants repeatedly imagined being in a meaningful location. Participants in the experimental condition imagined being in the meaningful location for the final time. Only participants who imagined “last times” at meaningful locations experienced more mixed emotions. In Study 2, college seniors reported their emotions on graduation day. Mixed emotions were higher when participants were reminded of the ending that they were experiencing. Findings suggest that poignancy is an emotional experience associated with meaningful endings.

Compared to other psychology studies, consider how the combination of sample size, p-value, effect size, statistical method complexity, first author citation count, and subfield influences replication likelihood. Provide a probability between 0 and 1 on the first line, then give a concise 2–3 sentence rationale that reflects this comparative judgment.",0.68,0.64,0.72,0.62,0.42,0.68,0.6266666667,"0.68
The study's simple design and analysis (an independent-samples t-test) increase its potential for successful replication. The sample size of 110 provides adequate statistical power (around 74%) to detect the reported small-to-medium effect size (d = .45). However, the p-value, which is greater than .01 (p ≈ .021), is not highly compelling and slightly tempers the prediction of success.
---
0.64
The study has a decent sample size for a t‑test (N=110) and a simple, transparent analysis, which are good signs for replicability. However, the reported p‑value is just below the .05 threshold (the exact p-value is ~.02), which suggests the evidence is not overwhelmingly strong and is a key factor that lowers confidence. The modest effect size (d=.45) means a replication would need similar or greater statistical power to reliably detect the effect.
---
0.72
This prediction is fairly high because the study uses a simple, transparent statistical analysis (an independent-samples t-test), which reduces researcher degrees of freedom and is easy to reproduce. The reported p-value is not borderline (the t-statistic yields p ≈ .021), and the moderate sample size provides reasonable statistical power for the observed medium effect size (d = .45). While some effect size inflation is possible, the strong theoretical grounding and straightforward design support a good chance of replication success.
---
0.62
The study has several strengths, including a straightforward t‑test analysis and an adequate sample size (N=110), which increase confidence. However, the test statistic corresponds to a p‑value of approximately .02, which is statistically significant but not overwhelmingly strong, and the effect size (d=.45) is modest. While the experienced author is a positive indicator, the marginal statistical evidence for a small‑to‑medium effect suggests a moderate probability of successful replication.
---
0.42
The primary concern is the reported p-value, which is just below the .05 threshold (calculated p≈.02), a range known to have lower replication rates. While the sample size is moderate and the analysis is simple, the small-to-medium effect size (d=.45) may be an overestimation common in original studies. These statistical weaknesses, combined with the fact that social psychology findings based on subjective manipulations can be sensitive to context, suggest a less than even chance of successful replication.
---
0.68
This study has a good chance of replicating due to its decent sample size for a lab experiment and a simple statistical analysis (t-test), which limits potential methodological issues. However, the original p-value is not overwhelmingly strong (p≈.02 based on the t-statistic) and the effect size is small-to-medium (d=.45), creating a risk that a replicated effect could be smaller and thus non-significant. These factors suggest a better-than-average, but not certain, probability of success."

This prediction is driven by the combination of a p-value (<.02) that is statistically significant but not highly robust and a modest sample size (N=71) for a between-subjects design. Furthermore, the key dependent variable (1/f noise) requires a complex analytical procedure that may be difficult to reproduce exactly, increasing the risk that a replication attempt would fail. While the medium effect size (d=.56) is a positive sign, the other factors suggest a substantial chance of non-replication.
---
0.40
The primary drivers for this prediction are the modest sample size (N=71) and a p‑value (p<.02) that is close to the significance threshold, which together suggest a heightened risk of a false positive or an overestimated effect size. A replication with higher statistical power would likely observe a smaller effect, which may not be significant. Additionally, the novel and complex nature of the 1/f noise analysis could introduce unstated methodological dependencies, making a successful replication more challenging.
---
0.62
The reported effect size is medium-to-large (d=.56) and the statistics are internally consistent, which are positive signs for replication. However, this is tempered by a p-value (<.02) that is not highly compelling and a moderate sample size (N=71) that offers only adequate, not high, statistical power. While the analysis is straightforward, the novel application of a complex cognitive science concept (1/f noise) to social psychology introduces uncertainty, as such innovative findings can sometimes prove less robust.
---
0.42
The reported medium-to-large effect size (d=0.56) is a positive indicator, but it is undermined by a p-value (p<.02) that is close to the standard significance threshold and a modest sample size (N=71). The novel and complex nature of the 1/f noise analysis, which is the core dependent measure, may be difficult to reproduce precisely. These statistical and methodological factors combine to suggest a less than even chance of a successful replication.
---
0.35
The primary concerns are the p-value (<.02) being close to the conventional .05 significance threshold and the modest sample size (N=71), which together suggest a statistically fragile result. While the reported medium effect size (d=.56) is promising, it may be an overestimation due to the small sample. Furthermore, the novel and complex analytic method (1/f noise), while innovative, could be difficult to implement precisely, potentially hindering a successful replication.
---
0.42
While the medium effect size (d=.56) is promising, the p-value is close to the conventional .05 threshold, which is associated with lower replication rates. The primary concern is the high complexity of the dependent variable, as calculating 1/f noise from raw latency data is a non-standard procedure with many analytical choices that could differ in a replication attempt. This analytical flexibility, combined with a moderate sample size for a between-subjects design, suggests the finding may be fragile."

According to GLOMO, inclusion versus exclusion should be influenced by whether people process information globally or locally. In 5 experiments, using both disambiguation and social comparison, the authors induced local versus global processing through perceptual tasks and time perspective and showed that global processing produced assimilation, whereas local processing produced contrast. The experiments showed that processing styles elicited in one task can carry over to other tasks and influence social judgments. Furthermore, they found that hemisphere activation and accessibility of judgment-consistent knowledge partially mediated these effects.

GLOMO is based on Schwarz and Bless' (1992, 2007) inclusion-exclusion model, which suggests that when information is included into a category, assimilation occurs, whereas when information is excluded from a category, contrast occurs. According to GLOMO, inclusion versus exclusion should be influenced by whether people process information globally or locally. In 5 experiments, using both disambiguation and social comparison, the authors induced local versus global processing through perceptual tasks and time perspective and showed that global processing produced assimilation, whereas local processing produced contrast. The experiments showed that processing styles elicited in one task can carry over to other tasks and influence social judgments. Furthermore, they found that hemisphere activation and accessibility of judgment-consistent knowledge partially mediated these effects. Implications for current and classic models of social judgment are discussed.

This study has a high probability of replication due to the extremely strong statistical evidence; the p-value is very low (<.0001) and the effect size is very large (ηp² = .362), suggesting a robust finding. While the sample size is modest by modern standards, it is likely sufficient to detect such a large effect. The prediction is tempered slightly because social cognition effects based on subtle manipulations can be context-sensitive and the reported effect size may be inflated.

This study has a very high probability of replication due to the overwhelming statistical evidence; the very low p‑value (<.0001) is supported by an extremely large effect size (ηp² = .362). While the sample size of 82 is only moderate, the study was exceptionally well-powered to detect such a large effect. Although complex social-cognitive effects can sometimes be fragile, the sheer magnitude of this finding suggests it is robust and likely to be replicated successfully.

The prediction is high due to the exceptionally strong statistical evidence. The p-value is very low (<.0001) and the effect size is very large (ηp² = .362), both of which are powerful predictors of replicability. Although the sample size (N=82) is not massive, it is more than sufficient to reliably detect an effect of this magnitude, and the use of a standard ANOVA reduces concerns about analytical flexibility.
---
0.85
This prediction is high due to the exceptionally strong reported evidence; the p-value is very low (p<.0001) and the effect size is unusually large (ηp²=.362). While the sample size is modest and social priming effects can be fragile, the sheer magnitude of the statistics suggests a very robust effect that is likely to replicate successfully. The confidence is further increased by the authors reporting a series of five experiments, which serves as a strong form of internal replication.
---
0.82
The reported p‑value is very low (<.0001) and the effect size is exceptionally large (ηp² = .362), both of which are strong positive predictors of replication success. Although the sample size is only moderate and carry‑over effects in social psychology can sometimes be difficult to replicate, the sheer magnitude of the reported effect suggests a robust phenomenon that would likely be detected again. The high citation count of the author and the inclusion of five experiments in the original paper also lend some confidence to the findings.
---
0.88
This study has a high probability of replication due to the combination of an extremely small p-value (p < .0001) and a very large effect size (ηp² = .362), which are the strongest statistical predictors of success. The finding's robustness is further supported by its demonstration across five separate experiments in the original paper. Although the sample size is modest, the massive effect size suggests the finding is not a statistical artifact and should be readily detectable in a new sample."

The abstract describes a finding demonstrated across 7 studies, a very strong indicator of robustness and internal replication. While the specific study's sample size of 45 is small, this concern is substantially offset by the highly significant p-value (<.01) and the large reported effect size (ηp² = .186). The combination of a strong statistical signal and a programmatic research approach suggests a high probability of replication success.
---
0.65
The reported p-value is strong and the effect size is large, and the abstract describes a programmatic series of 7 studies, which bolsters confidence in the core finding. However, the very small sample size (N=45) for this specific analysis is a major risk factor, as such studies are prone to inflated effect sizes and are less stable. While the effect is likely real, its magnitude may be smaller than reported, making a direct replication challenging.
---
0.70
This prediction is moderately high due to conflicting signals. The primary positive indicator is the abstract's claim that the effect was demonstrated across seven studies using diverse methods, suggesting a robust underlying phenomenon. However, this is tempered by the very small sample size (N=45) of the specific study described, which makes the strong reported p-value and large effect size less trustworthy and potentially inflated.
---
0.85
While the highlighted study's sample size (N=45) is very small, which risks effect size inflation, the abstract provides a powerful counterargument by stating the effect was demonstrated across seven studies. This prior internal replication suggests the finding is robust and not a statistical artifact. The large reported effect size and strong p‑value (<.01) further support the likelihood of a successful replication, even if the true effect is smaller than what was observed here.
---
0.65
The prediction is moderately optimistic because the reported effect was demonstrated across seven diverse studies in the original paper, suggesting a robust phenomenon with a low p-value (<.01). However, confidence is substantially tempered by the very small sample size for the reported statistic (N=45), which can produce inflated and unstable effect size estimates. Furthermore, the subfield of social psychology has historically had a lower rate of successful replications.
---
0.65
While the small sample size of 45 is a significant risk factor for replication failure and suggests the large effect size may be overestimated, this is counteracted by a strong p-value well below the typical threshold. Crucially, the abstract describes a programmatic series of seven studies supporting the same conclusion, which strongly suggests the underlying effect is robust and would likely be found in an independent replication."

The primary reasons for this low-to-moderate prediction are the marginal p-value and the small effect size. An F‑statistic of 4.15 yields a p‑value of approximately .044, which is very close to the .05 threshold and suggests the result may not be robust. Combined with a small effect size (ηp^2 = 0.035), this indicates the original study was likely underpowered, making a successful replication with a similar sample less probable.
---
0.35
The prediction is low primarily due to the combination of a small effect size (ηp² = 0.035) and a p-value that is just below the .05 threshold of significance. Such ""just-significant"" results are less likely to replicate, and the modest sample size (N=122) had low statistical power to reliably detect such a small effect. This combination suggests the original finding may have been a false positive or an inflated estimate, making a successful replication unlikely.
---
0.40
The primary reasons for this low prediction are the combination of a small effect size (ηp² = 0.035) and a reported p-value that is very close to the .05 significance threshold. An F-statistic of 4.15 with the given degrees of freedom yields a p-value of approximately .044, suggesting the finding is fragile and may not be robust. The study's statistical power to detect such a small effect was low (around 52%), which significantly reduces the likelihood that an independent, exact replication would also find a significant result.
---
0.35
The reported p-value is very close to the conventional threshold for significance (p<.05), and the associated F-statistic (F(1, 116) = 4.15) corresponds to an exact p-value of approximately .044. Such ""just significant"" results have a lower probability of successful replication. This concern is compounded by a small effect size (ηp² = 0.035), which suggests that even if the effect is real, it may be too subtle to be detected reliably without a much larger sample.
---
0.32
The primary reason for this low prediction is the reported p-value being just under the .05 threshold (the F-statistic yields a p-value of approximately .044), indicating a statistically fragile result. This is compounded by a small effect size (ηp^2 = 0.035) and a modest sample size, which suggests the original study may have been underpowered. Furthermore, social psychology, the study's subfield, has historically faced challenges with replication.
---
0.25
The low probability is primarily driven by the p-value being very close to the .05 significance threshold, a strong predictor of replication failure. This marginal result, combined with a small effect size (ηp² = 0.035) and a topic in social psychology (a subfield with known replication challenges), suggests the finding is not highly robust. The moderate sample size is not large enough to provide strong confidence in such a small, marginally significant effect."

The prediction is high due to the very large effect size (average proportion of 0.78) and simple statistical analysis (binomial test), which are strong indicators of replicability. The study's use of converging evidence from multiple cross-cultural samples, including an isolated preliterate tribe, provides a methodologically robust test of the hypothesis. Although a reported p-value of <.05 can be a weak sign, it is likely a conventional summary of a much more significant result given the large effect.
---
0.72
The reported p-value of <.05 is a negative indicator, as findings that are barely significant are less likely to replicate. However, this is strongly counteracted by the large reported effect size (average recognition proportion of 0.78), a simple and direct analysis (binomial test), and a robust cross-cultural methodology testing a foundational emotion recognition claim. The strong effect and sound study design suggest a high likelihood that the basic finding would be successfully replicated.
---
0.92
The prediction is high due to the very large reported effect size (average proportion of 0.78), which is easily detectable even with a moderate sample size. The study's use of a simple binomial test minimizes analytical flexibility, and the conclusion is supported by converging evidence across four distinct studies, including a strong test with a preliterate tribe. These factors combined suggest a robust and readily replicable finding.
---
0.85
This prediction is high primarily due to the very large reported effect size (average proportion correct of 0.78), which suggests a robust phenomenon that is likely to replicate even with a moderate sample size. The study’s strength is further enhanced by its use of a simple analysis (binomial test) and by the converging evidence found across multiple, highly diverse cultures, including an isolated tribe. While the imprecise p-value is a minor concern, the powerful effect and strong study design make a successful replication very likely.
---
0.88
The prediction is high due to a very large effect size (average proportion of 0.78, which is far from chance) and a simple, direct statistical analysis (binomial test), both strong predictors of replicability. While social psychology can have lower replication rates, this study's topic—basic emotion recognition—is often more robust, and the methodology is strong. The respectable sample size and experienced author further increase confidence in the finding.
---
0.92
This study has a very high probability of replication due to a combination of a large effect size (average recognition proportion of 0.78 is very high for this task) and a simple, direct statistical analysis (binomial test). While the p-value is reported imprecisely, the large effect and adequate sample size (N=211) suggest the true p-value is extremely small. The strong cross-cultural methodology, particularly using a preliterate, isolated tribe, further increases confidence that this is a robust, non-artifactual finding."

In 7 different studies, the authors observed that a large number of thinking biases are uncorrelated with cognitive ability. These thinking biases include some of the most classic and well-studied biases in the heuristics and biases literature, including the conjunction effect, framing effects, anchoring effects, outcome bias, base-rate neglect, ""less is more"" effects, affect biases, omission bias, myside bias, sunk-cost effect, and certainty effects that violate the axioms of expected utility theory. In a further experiment, the authors nonetheless showed that cognitive ability does correlate with the tendency to avoid some rational thinking biases, specifically the tendency to display denominator neglect, probability matching rather than maximizing, belief bias, and matching bias on the 4-card selection task. The authors present a framework for predicting when cognitive ability will and will not correlate with a rational thinking tendency.

The prediction for successful replication is high due to a strong combination of factors. The large sample size (N=375), highly significant p‑value (p<.001), and simple t-test analysis suggest a robust and reliable finding, not a statistical fluke. Although the effect size is moderate, it was estimated with good precision, and the high citation count of the first author adds to the confidence in the study's quality.

The prediction is high due to a combination of strong statistical evidence and study characteristics. The large sample size (N=375) provides a precise estimate, and the highly significant p-value (p<.001) signals a robust finding that is unlikely to be a false positive. Furthermore, the moderate effect size (d=0.493) was found using a simple analysis, reducing concerns about the result being an artifact of analytical complexity and suggesting it should be readily detectable in a replication attempt.

This study is highly likely to replicate due to the combination of a large sample size and very strong statistical evidence (p < .001, t = 4.40). The reported medium effect size (d ≈ 0.5) is substantial, and the use of a simple analysis like a t‑test minimizes concerns about analytical flexibility that can reduce replicability. The highly-cited author and well-established research area further increase confidence in the finding.

This prediction is high due to a combination of very strong statistical evidence and study characteristics. The reported p‑value is very low (p < .001) and the sample size is large (N=375), both of which are strong positive predictors of replication success. Additionally, the analysis is a simple t‑test, reducing potential for error, and the first author's extremely high citation count suggests significant expertise and methodological rigor.

The prediction is moderately high due to strong statistical evidence; the p-value of .002 is well below conventional significance thresholds, and the sample size of 261 is adequate for providing a stable estimate. However, the effect size is small-to-medium (ηp² = .042), and such effects can be more difficult to detect reliably. Furthermore, the study's central claim involves a mediation pathway, which is inherently more complex to replicate successfully than a simple main effect.

The prediction is moderately high due to the strong p-value (p=.002) and a solid sample size for this type of lab experiment (N=261), which suggest a reliable finding. However, the effect size is small-to-medium (ηp² = .042), indicating the phenomenon may be subtle and require a large sample to detect robustly in a replication. While the underlying mediational theory adds complexity, the core statistical evidence reported here is quite strong.

This study has a high likelihood of replication due to its strong p-value (p=.002) and solid sample size (N=261), suggesting the result is statistically robust and not a chance finding. While the effect size is small-to-medium (ηp² = .042), which can be harder to detect, the original study was well-powered and used a straightforward ANOVA, increasing confidence. The primary risk is the inherent difficulty of replicating any social psychology finding, but the statistical evidence here is strong.

The prediction is moderately high due to the strong p-value (.002) and a sufficient sample size (N=261), which are key indicators of replicability. While the effect size (ηp² = .042) is in the small-to-medium range, the original study was well-powered to detect it, increasing confidence in the finding. The use of a standard ANOVA for analysis also adds to the study's straightforwardness and likely robustness.

0.68
This prediction is moderately high due to a strong p-value (p = .002) and a solid sample size (N = 261), which suggest a statistically robust primary finding. However, this confidence is tempered because the effect size is small-to-medium (ηp² = .042) and the study is in social psychology. Effects in this subfield, especially complex ones involving mediation, can be sensitive to subtle contextual factors and thus have historically shown lower replication rates.
---
0.64
The probability is moderately high due to a strong p-value (p=.002) and a decent sample size for the subfield (N=261), which suggest the finding is not a statistical artifact. However, the effect size is relatively small (ηp²=.042), and such effects can be difficult to reproduce consistently. Furthermore, the abstract describes a mediation finding, which is inherently more complex and has more potential points of failure in a replication than the simple ANOVA test reported."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
People's opinions can deviate from that of the average group member in two ways. Descriptive deviants diverge from the average group attitude in a direction consistent with the desirable group attitude; prescriptive deviants diverge from the average group attitude in a direction inconsistent with the desirable group attitude. Three studies tested the hypothesis that descriptive deviants are more willing to express their opinions than either nondeviants or prescriptive deviants. Study 1 found that college students reported more comfort in expressing descriptive deviant opinions because descriptive deviance induced feelings of superior conformity (i.e., being ""different but good""). Study 2 found that descriptive deviants reported more pride after expressing their opinions, were rated as more proud by an observer, and were more willing to publicize their opinions. Study 3 showed that political bumper stickers with descriptive deviant messages were displayed disproportionately more frequently than were those with prescriptive deviant messages.

The primary drivers for this low replication estimate are the small sample size (N=37) and the reported p‑value being just under the .05 threshold, as indicated by a test statistic that barely achieves significance. Such statistically fragile findings often fail to replicate because the original result may have been due to sampling error rather than a true effect. While the reported effect size is medium, this estimate is likely inflated and highly imprecise given the low power of the original study.
---
0.25
The likelihood of a successful replication is low, primarily due to the combination of a very small sample size (N=37) and a p‑value that is just below the .05 significance threshold. The test statistic is statistically fragile, and the medium effect size is likely an overestimation due to the small sample. A higher-powered replication would probably find a smaller, non-significant effect.
---
0.25
The primary concerns are the very small sample size (N=37) and a p‑value that is just barely significant (a chi-squared value of 3.85 with 1 df corresponds to p≈.049). This combination suggests the study was severely underpowered, making the original result fragile and unlikely to replicate. Although the reported effect size is medium, it is likely an overestimation given the sample size.
---
0.35
This study has a low predicted replication success rate primarily due to the combination of a very small sample size (N=37) and a p‑value that is just barely below the .05 significance threshold. This combination suggests the study was underpowered and the result may be a false positive or reflect a substantially inflated effect size. While the abstract describes a series of three studies, which strengthens the theoretical claim, the specific statistical result presented is exceptionally fragile.
---
0.35
The primary predictors of a low replication probability here are the small sample size (N=37) and a p-value extremely close to the significance threshold of .05. Such ""just-significant"" results from low-powered studies are often not robust and are less likely to replicate successfully. While the medium effect size is a positive sign, these are often inflated in small samples, and the social psychology subfield has also historically shown lower replication rates.
---
0.25
The predicted probability is low because the result is barely statistically significant (p≈.049), a major risk factor for replication failure. This issue is compounded by the very small sample size (N=37), which suggests the finding is not robust and the medium effect size may be an overestimation. While the chi-squared analysis is straightforward, the combination of a borderline p-value and low power makes a successful replication unlikely."

The reported p-value is strong (p<.01) and the sample size is adequate (N=246), which are positive indicators for replicability. However, the effect size is small (partial eta-squared = 0.041), and such effects are often less robust. Furthermore, the finding is a complex interaction effect in social psychology, which can be sensitive to subtle contextual differences between the original and replication labs, tempering the overall likelihood of success.
---
0.68
The original study presents strong statistical evidence with a p-value <.01 and an adequate sample size (N=246). Although the effect size is modest (ηp²=0.041) and complex interactions can be difficult to replicate, the most compelling factor is that the finding was demonstrated across four separate studies. This internal replication suggests the effect is robust to different operationalizations, substantially increasing the predicted likelihood of a successful independent replication.
---
0.58
The prediction is moderately positive due to the study's solid sample size and a p‑value comfortably below the standard threshold, lending it statistical strength. However, the effect size (ηp² = 0.041) is small-to-medium, and nuanced interaction effects in social psychology can be sensitive to context, which tempers the probability of success. The existence of four supporting studies in the original paper is a positive sign for the robustness of the core theory.
---
0.65
The prediction is moderately high because the original study reports a strong p-value (p<.01) from an adequate sample size (N=246), suggesting the finding is robust. Confidence is tempered, however, because the effect size is small-to-medium (ηp²=0.041) and the finding is a nuanced interaction, a type of result that can be more context-dependent and difficult to replicate.
---
0.65
The prediction is moderately optimistic due to a decent sample size and a strong p‑value (p<.01), which suggest the finding is not a simple statistical artifact. The abstract also describes a series of four studies, providing evidence of internal replication that bolsters confidence in the result. However, this is tempered by a small-to-medium effect size and the fact that nuanced interaction effects in social psychology have historically shown lower replication rates.
---
0.62
The strong p-value (p<.01) and decent sample size (N=246) provide a solid statistical foundation, suggesting the finding is not a statistical fluke. However, the effect size is small-to-medium (ηp² = 0.041), and complex interaction effects in social psychology can be sensitive to context and thus harder to replicate than simple main effects. The reporting of four separate studies in the paper demonstrating the effect across different contexts is a significant strength that bolsters confidence in its replicability."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
The authors investigated whether an implemental mind-set fosters stronger attitudes. Participants who made a decision about how to act (vs. those who held off) expressed a more extreme attitude toward an issue unrelated to the decision (Experiment 1). Participants who planned the implementation of a decision (vs. deliberated vs. control) exhibited less ambivalent (Experiment 2) and more accessible (Experiment 3) attitudes toward various objects unrelated to the decision. Moreover, an attitude reported by planning participants better predicted self-reported behavior 1 week later (Experiment 4). Finally, results suggest that the effect of an implemental mind-set on attitude strength toward unrelated objects is driven by a focus on information that supports an already-made decision (Experiment 5). Implications for attitudes, goals, and mind-sets are discussed.

The prediction is low due to the combination of a very small sample size (N=46 for a 3-group design) and a p-value that is just barely below the conventional .05 threshold. This pattern suggests the study was underpowered and the large reported effect size is likely inflated, making the finding less stable.

The prediction is low due to the combination of a very small sample size (N=46) and a p-value just under the conventional .05 threshold, which suggests the finding is statistically fragile. Although the reported effect size is large, such estimates are often inflated in low-powered studies. The ""mind-set"" topic in social-cognitive psychology has also faced replication challenges, adding to the skepticism.
---
0.25
The study's very small sample size (N=46) for a three-group design yields low statistical power, making the result less reliable. Furthermore, the test statistic produces a p-value just under the .05 threshold, a value range that is a strong statistical predictor of replication failure. The large effect size (ηp² = .135) is likely an overestimation due to the small sample, a phenomenon known as the “winner’s curse,” and would probably be smaller in a higher-powered replication.

The predicted probability is low primarily due to the very small sample size (N=46 for a three-group design) and a p-value just below the conventional .05 threshold. These factors suggest the original study was underpowered, likely resulting in an inflated effect size estimate. Complex social-cognitive effects of this nature can also be difficult to reproduce reliably.

0.25
This prediction is low due to the small sample size (N=46), which provides low statistical power and increases the risk of a type I error. The reported p-value is very close to the .05 significance threshold (the calculated p-value is ≈.043), a factor strongly associated with replication failures. Although the effect size is large, in a low-powered study this is likely an inflation of the true effect, and studies in social psychology with counterintuitive findings have historically shown lower replication rates.

The study reports a medium effect size (ηp² = .07) and a p‑value that is stronger than the reported threshold, which are positive indicators for replication. However, the moderate sample size (N=94) means the study was not highly powered, and the effect size estimate may be somewhat inflated. Overall, the solid effect and the fact that it is one of four supporting studies described in the abstract suggest a good likelihood of replication success, despite the potential for fragility common in social interaction studies.
---
0.58
The prediction is cautiously optimistic due to the reported medium effect size (ηp² = .07) and an adequate sample size for a between-subjects design. These factors suggest a potentially robust finding that a replication study would have fair power to detect. However, this optimism is tempered by the reported p-value of ""<.05,"" which is often associated with lower replicability than more extreme p-values, and the fact that complex social-psychological interactions can be sensitive to subtle contextual differences.
---
0.68
This prediction is moderately high due to several positive indicators. The reported F‑statistic corresponds to a p‑value of approximately .01, which is substantially stronger than the p<.05 threshold and suggests a robust finding. Furthermore, the between-subjects ANOVA is a straightforward analysis with limited flexibility, which generally aids replicability. These strengths are balanced against a modest sample size and a small-to-medium effect size, which means a replication would need to be adequately powered to reliably detect the effect.
---
0.63
The study's reported statistics are fairly solid, with a medium effect size (ηp² = .07) and an F-statistic that implies a p-value (≈.01) stronger than the reported ""<.05"". However, the sample size of 94 is only moderate, which provides decent but not overwhelming statistical power, especially considering the ""winner's curse"" may inflate the original effect size. While the simple ANOVA design is a positive factor, the social psychology context makes the results potentially sensitive to subtle procedural differences, leading to a moderately positive but not certain chance of replication success.
---
0.72
The study has several strengths favoring replication, including a p-value (p≈.01) that is well below the conventional .05 threshold and a medium effect size (ηp² = .07). The sample size of 94 provides good statistical power for an effect of this magnitude, and the analysis is a standard ANOVA. While social psychology has historically shown lower replication rates and interaction effects can be fragile, the strong statistical evidence makes a successful replication reasonably likely.
---
0.62
The reported effect size is medium (ηp² = .07) and the p-value is reasonably robust (p ≈ .01, calculated from the F-statistic), which are positive signs for replication. However, the sample size of 94 is only moderate for a between-subjects design, which could lead to an overestimation of the true effect size. While the simple ANOVA is a strength, complex social psychology manipulations can be difficult to reproduce consistently, resulting in a slightly better than even chance of replication success."

Similarly, electoral success is based on voters' impressions of candidates, which are also responsible for which candidates are elected. In the current study, we examined the relation between a subjective predictor and an objective performance outcome: Are impressions of chief executive officers (CEOs) related to the performance of their companies?

The predicted probability of successful replication is low due to several statistical weaknesses. The sample size (N=50) is small for detecting a modest effect (r=.30), and the reported p-value (<.05) is very close to the significance threshold, a strong negative predictor of replicability. The analysis, a partial correlation with a high number of implied control variables for the sample size, also increases the risk that the finding is a statistical artifact or overfit to this specific dataset.

The predicted replication probability is very low due to a convergence of risk factors. The reported p-value is at the threshold of significance, a strong predictor of replication failure, and the sample size (N=50) is small for a design using a partial correlation to control for seven other variables. These factors suggest the original result has a high chance of being a false positive or that the reported effect size (r=.30) is a substantial overestimation of any true effect.
---
0.25
The predicted likelihood of replication is low due to the combination of a small sample size (N=50) and a p-value reported as just below the significance threshold of .05. The use of a partial correlation controlling for a large number of variables relative to the sample size increases the risk of overfitting the data and finding a spurious effect. These factors indicate that the result is statistically fragile and may not be robust enough to replicate.
---
0.25
The study's small sample size (N=50) and a p-value just below the .05 threshold are strong indicators of low replicability, as such results are often statistically fragile. Additionally, the degrees of freedom for the partial correlation, r(41), imply that a large number of covariates were used relative to the sample size, which increases the risk of finding a spurious result. These factors suggest the modest effect size (r=.30) may be an overestimate and is unlikely to be found in a replication attempt.

The probability of replication is low due to the combination of a small sample size (N=50) and a p-value just below the .05 significance threshold. This pattern suggests the result is not statistically robust and may be a false positive or have an inflated effect size. Additionally, the analysis is a partial correlation that controls for a large number of covariates relative to the sample size, which increases the risk of finding a spurious relationship.

The replication probability is low due to a combination of a small sample size (N=50) and a p-value just under the .05 significance threshold. Furthermore, the degrees of freedom for the partial correlation (df=41) indicate that a large number of covariates were controlled for, increasing the risk of an overfitted model and a spurious finding.

The reported p-value (0.001) is very low and the effect size is very large (d > 1), both of which are strong positive predictors of replicability. However, the sample size (N=52) is very small, which is a significant weakness that can produce unstable and inflated effect estimates. The strong statistical evidence suggests a real effect is likely present, but its magnitude is probably overestimated, creating moderate uncertainty about a successful replication.

The reported p-value is very low (p < .001) and the effect size is large (d ≈ 1.17), which are strong positive indicators for replicability. However, the sample size is quite small (N=52), which increases the risk that the effect is overestimated or is a statistical fluke despite the p-value. While the straightforward chi-squared analysis is a plus, the finding is a nuanced interaction effect in social psychology, a combination that has historically had mixed replication success.
---
0.72
The prediction is moderately high due to very strong statistical evidence; the p-value is low (0.001) and the effect size is large (d=1.17), both of which are strong predictors of replication success. However, the very small sample size (N=52) is a significant weakness, as it increases the risk that this large effect is a spurious overestimate due to sampling error. The simple Chi-squared analysis is a positive factor, but the confidence in the finding is tempered by the high risk associated with small-N studies.
---
0.55
The extremely low p-value (p=0.001) is a strong predictor of replication success. However, this finding is based on a small sample size (N=52), which increases the risk that the very large reported effect size (d=1.17) is an overestimate of the true effect. While the simple analysis and experienced author are positive indicators, the small sample significantly tempers the likelihood that a replication would reproduce such a large effect.
---
0.45
The prediction is below 0.5 despite a highly significant p-value because the study's small sample size (N=52) is a major risk factor for non-replication. While the very low p-value (.001) is a positive signal, such results from underpowered studies can be unstable and their large effect sizes are often inflated. This risk is compounded by the study's origin in social psychology, a subfield that has historically demonstrated lower replication rates for subtle effects.
---
0.45
Although the study reports a highly significant p-value (0.001) with a simple analysis, the very small sample size (N=52) is a major concern for replicability. Small samples can produce unstable and inflated effect sizes, making the reported large effect (d=1.17) likely an overestimate of the true effect. A well-powered replication is therefore likely to find a smaller effect that may not reach statistical significance."

Alternative explanations based on processes of ego threat, cognitive load, and mood were ruled out. Mediational analyses suggested that individuals with depleted self-regulation resources experienced increased levels of commitment to their own standpoint, which resulted in increased confirmatory information processing. In sum, the impact of ego depletion on confirmatory information search seems to be more motivational than cognitive in nature.

The prediction for a successful replication is low primarily because the study is based on the concept of ego depletion, a theory that has famously failed to replicate in large-scale, preregistered studies. This foundational issue is compounded by a relatively small sample size and a p-value (.02) that is close to the conventional threshold for statistical significance, suggesting the original finding may be a false positive or have an inflated effect size. While the finding is reported across four studies, shared methodological weaknesses can undermine such internal replications.
---
0.25
The primary reason for the low prediction is the study's focus on ego depletion, a research area that has notoriously suffered from major replication failures. The reported p-value of .02, while significant, is close to the conventional .05 threshold and is associated with a lower replication rate than more extreme p-values. Although the reported effect size is substantial, the relatively small sample size for a between-subjects design raises the possibility that the effect is an overestimation.
---
0.20
The study's foundation on ego depletion, a concept with a well-documented replication crisis, raises significant concerns. This is compounded by a relatively small sample size and a p-value of .02, which is close to the significance threshold and often associated with lower replication rates. While the reported effect size is medium-to-large, it is likely inflated due to the low statistical power of the original study.
---
0.25
The prediction is low primarily because the study investigates ego depletion, a concept from social psychology that has famously failed to replicate in large-scale studies. Furthermore, the small sample size (N=85) and a p-value (p=.02) that is close to the significance threshold indicate the original finding may lack statistical robustness. These factors suggest a high risk of a false positive, making successful replication unlikely.

The study's core concept of ""ego depletion"" has performed poorly in large-scale replication projects, raising significant a priori doubts. This primary concern is compounded by a p-value of 0.02, which is close to the significance threshold, and a relatively small sample size for a between-subjects design. While the reported effect size is medium-to-large, such estimates can be inflated in low-powered studies, making a successful replication unlikely.

The probability of successful replication is low. The study's focus on ego depletion is a major concern, as this research area has a well-documented history of failed replications. Furthermore, the small sample size (N=85) and a p-value (p=0.02) that is close to the significance threshold suggest the original result may be statistically fragile and unlikely to reproduce in a higher-powered study."

While the reported p-value is strong (<.01) and the effect size is large (ηp² = .16), the small sample size of 55 for a between-subjects design makes this estimate unstable and likely inflated. Furthermore, findings from social psychology that rely on subtle manipulations of psychological states (like stereotype threat) have historically demonstrated low replication rates.

0.65
The strong statistical evidence, with a p‑value <.01 and a large effect size (ηp² = .16), suggests a high likelihood of replication. However, this optimism is tempered by the very small sample size (N=55), which makes it plausible that the reported effect is an overestimation (the “winner’s curse”). Additionally, stereotype threat effects can be highly sensitive to subtle contextual factors, making them challenging to replicate precisely.

While the reported p-value is strong (p < .01) and the effect size is large (ηp² = .16), the study's small sample size (N=55) is a major concern for replicability.

The reported p-value is strong (p<.01) and the effect size is large (ηp² = .16), which are positive signs. However, the very small sample size (N=55) for a between-subjects design creates a high risk that the effect size is inflated and that the original study was underpowered. The social psychology subfield and the subtlety of the stereotype threat manipulation can also present challenges for a successful replication.

While the reported p-value (<.01) and large effect size (ηp² = .16) are strong on their own, the small sample size of 55 for a between-subjects design suggests the effect may be overestimated. Furthermore, social psychology studies on subtle situational effects like stereotype threat have historically faced challenges in replication due to their high sensitivity to context. These methodological and subfield characteristics reduce confidence despite the strong initial statistics.

0.42
Although the study reports a strong p-value (<.01) and a large effect size (ηp² = .16), the small sample size of 55 for a between-subjects design is a major weakness. Social psychology findings involving subtle behavioral measures like distancing can be highly context-dependent and have shown lower historical rates of replication. The combination of a small sample and a large effect raises concerns about effect size inflation (the ""winner's curse""), making a successful replication less probable."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
In paradigms in which participants state their ideal romantic-partner preferences or examine vignettes and photographs, men value physical attractiveness more than women do, and women value earning prospects more than men do. Yet it remains unclear if these preferences remain sex differentiated in predicting desire for real-life potential partners (i.e., individuals whom one has actually met). In the present study, the authors explored this possibility using speed dating and longitudinal follow-up procedures. Replicating previous research, participants exhibited traditional sex differences when stating the importance of physical attractiveness and earning prospects in an ideal partner and ideal speed date. However, data revealed no sex differences in the associations between participants' romantic interest in real-life potential partners (met during and outside of speed dating) and the attractiveness and earning prospects of those partners. Furthermore, participants' ideal preferences, assessed before the speed-dating event, failed to predict what inspired their actual desire at the event. Results are discussed within the context of R. E. Nisbett and T. D. Wilson's (1977) seminal article: Even regarding such a consequential aspect of mental life as romantic-partner preferences, people may lack introspective awareness of what influences their judgments and behavior.

Compared to other psychology studies, consider how the combination of sample size, p-value, effect size, statistical method complexity, first author citation count, and subfield influences replication likelihood.

The study's primary claim is a null effect (p = .48), which is supported by a near-zero effect size (r = .04). Replicating a well-supported null finding is often more likely than replicating a marginal positive finding, as the original result is not likely to be a Type I error. While the sample size is moderate and the analysis is highly complex, the evidence for the absence of an effect is so statistically unambiguous that an independent replication would very likely also find a non-significant result.
---
0.85
The study's primary claim is a null finding (p=.48), which is often more likely to replicate than a marginal significant finding. The reported effect size is trivial (r=.04) and was observed in a moderately-sized sample (N=163), suggesting the finding of no sex difference is robust and not merely due to low statistical power. Although the multilevel modeling analysis is complex, the result is so far from statistical significance that a replication is very likely to yield a similar null effect.
---
0.75
This prediction is relatively high because the study's central claim is a null finding (p=.48), which is strongly supported by a trivial effect size (r=.04). Well-supported null findings are often robust, as they are not subject to the same publication biases or p-hacking pressures as significant results. However, the analysis is exceptionally complex—summarizing 14 multilevel models—which introduces many researcher degrees of freedom and could make the specific result difficult to reproduce precisely.
---
0.85
The prediction is high because the study’s central claim is a null finding (no sex difference), which is strongly supported by a very high p-value (p = .48) and a trivial effect size (r = .04). A replication is considered successful if it finds a consistent result, and it is highly probable that another study would also fail to find a significant effect. While the analysis is complex, the reported statistics are so far from the significance threshold that this result is likely to be robust.
---
0.85
The study's primary conclusion is a null finding, which is strongly supported by a very high p-value (.48) and a trivial effect size (r = .04). A successful replication would mean finding a similarly non-significant result, which is highly probable given this clear statistical evidence. While the analytical complexity and social psychology subfield introduce some risk, the data are so consistent with the null hypothesis that a different outcome in a replication is unlikely.
---
0.40
The reported p-value (0.48) and very small effect size (r = .04) provide strong evidence for the null finding, which on its own would suggest high replicability. However, the study's primary weakness is its extreme analytical complexity, involving a meta-analytic summary of 14 multilevel models. This complexity, along with the unusually low degrees of freedom for the reported test, makes the specific result less likely to be reproduced in an independent replication."

This prediction is high primarily because the abstract describes a programmatic series of nine studies (eight experiments and one correlational study) that all strongly support the proposed model, suggesting the overall effect is robust. While the specific study's effect size is small-to-medium (sr^2 = .07) for a moderate sample size (N=91), the p-value is quite strong (<.01), and the first author is highly established. The convergence of evidence from multiple studies increases the likelihood that a direct, well-powered replication would succeed.
---
0.75
The prediction is based on strong statistical evidence, including a p-value well below the conventional threshold (p<.01) and a medium effect size (sr^2=.07). While the theoretical model is complex and the sample size is only moderate, the reported statistics for this specific finding suggest a robust effect that has a good chance of replicating. The high citation count of the first author may also suggest a well-vetted research program, though this is a weaker indicator.
---
0.45
While the reported p-value is strong (<.01) and the effect size is moderate (sr^2=.07), the sample size of 91 is relatively small for a hierarchical regression analysis, which can lead to an overestimated effect. The high complexity of the overall research program, which encompasses nine studies supporting a multi-stage social cognition model, also suggests that the specific reported finding may be fragile or a product of analytical flexibility. Therefore, a successful independent replication of this single effect may be challenging.
---
0.72
This prediction is moderately high due to the strong statistical evidence, with a p‑value well under .01 and a medium effect size (sr^2 = .07). The first author’s high citation count also suggests an experienced and well-regarded lab, which is a positive sign for rigor. However, confidence is tempered because the moderate sample size and the complexity of the theory and hierarchical regression analysis could make the specific effect difficult to reproduce precisely.
---
0.65
This prediction is driven by strong statistical evidence for the specific finding, including a medium effect size (sr^2 = .07) and a p-value well below .05. Although complex interaction effects in social psychology can be difficult to replicate, confidence is significantly bolstered by the paper's reported series of eight experiments supporting the core model, which suggests internal robustness. The moderate sample size and complexity of the theory, however, temper the prediction against a higher value.
---
0.45
The reported p-value is strong (<.01) and the effect size is medium, which are positive indicators for replication. However, these are counteracted by significant risks: the theoretical model is highly complex, testing interactions between traits and states, a type of finding that is often hard to replicate. The modest sample size of 91 may be underpowered for the hierarchical regression analysis, and the social-cognitive subfield has historically shown mixed replication success for these kinds of effects."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
Researchers interested in counterfactual thinking have often found that upward counterfactual thoughts lead to increased motivation to improve in the future, although at the cost of increased negative affect. The present studies suggest that because upward counterfactual thoughts indicate reasons for a poor performance, they can also serve as excuses. In this case, upward counterfactual thoughts should result in more positive self-esteem and reduced future motivation. Five studies demonstrated these effects in the context of self-handicapping. First, upward counterfactual thinking was increased in the presence of a self-handicap. Second, upward counterfactual thoughts indicating the presence of a self-handicap protected self-esteem following failure. Finally, upward counterfactual thoughts that protect self-esteem reduced preparation for a subsequent performance as well as performance itself. These findings suggest that the consequences of upward counterfactuals for affect and motivation are moderated by the goals of the individual as well as the content of the thoughts.

Note:
Compared to other psychology studies, consider how the combination of sample size, p-value, effect size, statistical method complexity, first author citation count, and subfield influences replication likelihood. Provide a probability between 0 and 1 on the first line, then give a concise 2–3 sentence rationale that reflects this comparative judgment.",0.18,0.15,0.25,0.25,0.15,0.25,0.205,"0.18
The prediction is very low due to the combination of an extremely small sample size and a p‑value just under the .05 threshold. These factors indicate the study was severely underpowered, meaning the large reported effect size is likely a significant overestimation and the result has a high chance of being a false positive. Consequently, a well‑powered independent replication is unlikely to achieve a statistically significant result.
---
0.15
The primary reasons for this low prediction are the very small sample size (N=28) and the marginal p-value. A t-statistic of 1.87 with 26 degrees of freedom corresponds to a two-tailed p-value of .072, which is not statistically significant and contradicts the reported p<.05, suggesting the finding is not robust. While the effect size is large, such estimates are often highly inflated in small, underpowered studies, making it unlikely that a replication attempt would find a similar, statistically significant effect.
---
0.25
The prediction is low due to several statistical weaknesses. The very small sample size (N=28) provides low statistical power, and the reported p-value is questionable, as the test statistic (t=1.87) yields a two-tailed p-value of approximately .07, which is not significant at the conventional .05 level. These factors suggest the original finding is fragile and has a high probability of being a Type I error or a substantial overestimation of the true effect.
---
0.25
The prediction is low primarily due to the very small sample size (N=28) and a p-value that is just below the significance threshold of .05 (the exact p-value for this t-statistic is borderline). Small, low-powered studies often produce statistically significant results by chance or through inflated effect size estimates, making them difficult to replicate. While the analysis is simple, these major statistical weaknesses suggest a high risk that the original finding was not robust.
---
0.15
The prediction is very low due to the extremely small sample size (N=28), which yields low statistical power and increases the chance of a false positive. Critically, the reported p-value of <.05 is highly suspect, as the t-statistic of 1.87 only yields a p-value of ~.07 for a standard two-tailed test, making the finding non-significant. Such results on the cusp of significance from underpowered studies, especially in social psychology, have a very low probability of successful replication.
---
0.25
The extremely small sample size (N=28) provides low statistical power and makes the finding highly sensitive to sampling error. Furthermore, the test statistic yields a p-value that is barely significant (and only if a one-tailed test was justified), a pattern strongly associated with failed replications. These factors suggest the large reported effect size is likely a substantial overestimation, making a successful replication with a well-powered sample improbable."

This study has a high probability of replication due to its very strong statistical evidence, including a low p‑value (p = .001) and a large reported effect size (ηp^2 = .143). Although the sample size (N=90) is modest, which raises some concern about effect size inflation, the strength of the F‑statistic and the straightforward ANOVA design suggest the core finding is robust. The topic's potential sensitivity to social context is the primary remaining risk factor for a direct replication.

The reported p-value is very low (p = .001) and the partial eta-squared effect size is large (ηp² = .14), which are both strong positive predictors of replication success. While the sample size of 90 is only moderate, it is sufficient to reliably detect an effect of this magnitude. These strong statistical signals, combined with a standard analysis (ANOVA) and an experienced first author, suggest a high likelihood of a successful replication.

This prediction is based on the study's very strong p‑value (0.001) and large effect size (ηp² = .143), which are key indicators of a robust and replicable finding. This optimism is tempered by the modest sample size and the fact that social psychology effects can be sensitive to context, historically showing lower replication rates. However, the strong statistical evidence for this specific effect is compelling enough to suggest a high likelihood of success.

The prediction is high due to compelling statistical evidence, including a very low p-value (0.001) and a large effect size (ηp² = .14). While the sample size of 90 is relatively small and the study is in social psychology—a field with mixed replication history—the strength of this initial evidence suggests a robust finding. The use of a simple, standard analysis (ANOVA) further increases confidence that the result is not an artifact of complex methods."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
People construe the world along a continuum from concretely (focusing on specific, local details) to abstractly (focusing on global essences). We show that people are more likely to interpret the world abstractly when they experience cognitive disfluency, or difficulty processing stimuli in the environment, than when they experience cognitive fluency. We observed this effect using three instantiations of fluency: visual perceptual fluency (Study 1b), conceptual priming fluency (Study 2b), and linguistic fluency (Study 3). Adopting the framework of construal theory, we suggest that one mechanism for this effect is perceivers' tendency to interpret disfluently processed stimuli as farther from their current position than fluently processed stimuli (Studies 1a and 2a).

Key details:
- Sample size: 236
- Analysis type (e.g. rm ANOVA, mixed ANOVA, regression, t‑test): Pearson's Chi-squared test

Compared to other psychology studies, consider how the combination of sample size, p-value, effect size, statistical method complexity, first author citation count, and subfield influences replication likelihood. Provide a probability between 0 and 1 on the first line, then give a concise 2–3 sentence rationale that reflects this comparative judgment.",0.25,0.32,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.2616666667,"0.25
The prediction is low due to the combination of a very small effect size (phi = .13) and a p‑value resting exactly on the threshold for significance (p = .05). This combination strongly suggests the original study was underpowered, giving it a low probability of detecting an effect of this small magnitude. Such marginal findings are highly sensitive to sampling error and are statistically unlikely to replicate successfully.
---
0.32
The reported p-value of exactly 0.05, combined with a small effect size (phi = .13), suggests the original finding was fragile and may have been underpowered. While the sample size is moderate, this type of subtle effect within social-cognitive psychology has historically proven difficult to replicate. Therefore, the weak statistical evidence for a small effect results in a low predicted probability of success.
---
0.25
The reported p-value of 0.05 is the strongest indicator, as results that are barely significant are much less likely to replicate. This weak evidence is coupled with a small effect size (phi = .13), suggesting the original study was underpowered and may have capitalized on sampling error. While the simple chi-squared analysis is a positive factor, the fragility of the statistical evidence makes a successful replication improbable.
---
0.25
The prediction is low primarily due to the combination of a p-value exactly at the .05 threshold and a small effect size (phi = .13). Such ""just-significant"" results are statistically fragile and often fail to replicate, especially when the original study was likely underpowered for such a small effect. While the analysis is simple and the sample size is moderate, these factors are outweighed by the weak primary evidence.
---
0.25
The prediction is low primarily due to the reported p-value of exactly 0.05, a strong statistical predictor of replication failure, which suggests the finding is on the threshold of significance. This result, combined with a small effect size (phi = .13), implies the original study was underpowered and the effect may not be robust. Additionally, the study falls within social-cognitive psychology, a subfield where subtle experimental manipulations like cognitive fluency have historically proven difficult to replicate reliably.
---
0.25
The probability is low primarily due to the reported p-value of exactly 0.05, which, combined with a test statistic that is just shy of the traditional significance threshold, is a major red flag for non-replicability. The small effect size (phi = .13) is likely an overestimate and would require a much larger sample to be detected reliably in a replication attempt. While the analysis method is simple, the subfield (social cognition) and the borderline statistical evidence strongly suggest a fragile effect."

The primary concern is the very small sample size (N=36), which provides low statistical power and increases the chance that the finding is unstable. While the reported effect size is large (d=0.82), it is likely inflated due to the small sample, and the p-value (p<.05 from an F-statistic of 5.8) is not overwhelmingly strong. Studying young children can also introduce high variability, further challenging the replicability of the specific linguistic effect.
---
0.35
The primary concerns for replication are the very small sample size and a p-value that is significant but not highly compelling. These factors suggest the large reported effect size may be an overestimation, a common issue in underpowered studies. Additionally, the use of a developmental sample (young children) can introduce high variability, making the results sensitive to subtle procedural differences.
---
0.45
The study reports a large effect size, which is a strong positive indicator for replicability. However, the small sample size (N=36) and a p‑value just under the .05 threshold (p≈.02 for the reported F‑statistic) are significant weaknesses. This combination suggests the large effect size may be an overestimate due to low statistical power, decreasing the likelihood that a replication attempt would succeed.
---
0.35
The primary drivers for this low prediction are the small sample size and the p‑value being close to the significance threshold. Studies with small samples (N=36) are often underpowered, which can produce inflated effect size estimates and results that are not robust. While the experimental design and cognitive subfield are positive indicators, the weak statistical evidence (F(1, 34) = 5.8) suggests a high probability that a well‑powered replication would fail to find a significant effect.

0.28
The primary concerns for replication are the very small sample size and a p-value that, while technically significant, is close to the .05 threshold. These factors suggest the large reported effect size may be an overestimation due to sampling error. Although the experimental design is straightforward, this weak statistical evidence makes a successful replication unlikely.
---
0.42
While the study reports a large effect size, which is a positive indicator, this is offset by major risk factors for replication failure. The small sample size (N=36) provides low statistical power, and the reported p-value is not highly convincing (the F-statistic corresponds to p≈.02), suggesting the result may not be robust. Such studies often have inflated effect size estimates, and a well-powered replication may find a much smaller, non-significant effect."

The prevalent view of automaticity and control implies that an unconscious mode of goal pursuit can only reproduce formerly learned actions, and therefore that its usefulness in novel environments is very limited. Our results demonstrate that this conclusion is not always warranted, as nonconscious goal pursuit facilitated participants' learning of the structure of completely novel environments. Specifically, two experiments, using markedly different implicit-learning paradigms, demonstrated facilitation of implicit learning when the goal of achievement was primed. We propose that nonconscious goal pursuit can facilitate not only reproductive operations, but also productive ones, and that implicit learning is sensitive to the organism's nonconscious goals.

Compared to other psychology studies, consider how the combination of sample size, p-value, effect size, statistical method complexity, first author citation count, and subfield influences replication likelihood.

This prediction is low because the reported statistics yield a p-value (p≈.04) that is just below the standard significance threshold, a range known for lower replication rates. The study's modest sample size for a between-subjects design also suggests it was underpowered, likely resulting in an overestimated effect size. The subfield of nonconscious priming has historically demonstrated poor replicability, further reducing confidence in the finding.
---
0.25
The reported test statistic corresponds to a p-value of approximately .04, which is just barely below the conventional .05 significance threshold; such results are statistically fragile and often fail to replicate. This concern is amplified by the low statistical power afforded by the modest sample size, which increases the chance of an inflated effect size estimate. Furthermore, the topic of nonconscious priming has a well-documented history of replication difficulties in the broader literature.
---
0.35
The reported t-statistic yields a p-value just under the .05 threshold, suggesting the finding is fragile. The sample size of 86 provides low statistical power (about 53%) to detect the reported medium effect size (d=.45), increasing the likelihood of a false positive or an inflated effect size estimate. Furthermore, the topic of nonconscious priming within social cognition is a subfield that has historically faced significant replication challenges.
---
0.22
The reported test statistic corresponds to a p-value of approximately .04, which is just below the conventional significance threshold; such marginal results are less likely to replicate successfully. Furthermore, the study has low statistical power for a between-subjects design given the sample size of 86. The research area of nonconscious priming has also historically faced significant replication challenges, casting further doubt on the robustness of the finding.
---
0.25
This prediction is low due to a convergence of risk factors, most notably a p-value just below the .05 significance threshold (inferred from the t-statistic) combined with a small sample size. Such ""barely significant"" findings in underpowered studies are less likely to replicate, and the reported effect size is likely inflated. Additionally, research on nonconscious priming in social and cognitive psychology has historically demonstrated low replication rates, casting further doubt on this novel claim.
---
0.28
The low probability is driven by two main factors: the p-value is very close to the .05 threshold (t(84)=2.09 corresponds to p≈.04), and the study uses a social priming paradigm, a subfield with a history of replication challenges. The modest sample size offers low statistical power to reliably detect the small-to-medium effect size, increasing the chance the original result was a false positive or its effect size was overestimated."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
The anchoring-and-adjustment heuristic has been used to account for a wide variety of numerical judgments. Five studies show that adjustment away from a numerical anchor is smaller if the anchor is precise than if it is rounded. Evidence suggests that precise anchors, compared with rounded anchors, are represented on a subjective scale with a finer resolution. If adjustment consists of a series of iterative mental movements along a subjective scale, then an adjustment from a precise anchor should result in a smaller overall correction than an adjustment from a rounded anchor.

While the reported effect size is small (η² = .02) and the sample size is modest, increasing the risk of a replication failure, several factors suggest a higher probability of success. The reported F-statistic corresponds to a p-value of ~.01, which is reasonably strong evidence, and the anchoring effect is a classic, robust phenomenon. Most importantly, the abstract states that the paper presents five separate studies, suggesting the finding has been internally replicated and is not a statistical fluke from a single underpowered experiment.

This study has a high risk of non-replication due to its low statistical power. The combination of a small sample size (N=59) and a small effect size (η² = .02) suggests the original result may be an overestimation of the true effect. While the p-value is significant (p ≈ .01), it is not overwhelmingly strong and is insufficient to overcome the concerns raised by the study's low power.
---
0.35
The reported effect size is very small (η² = .02) and was observed in a relatively small sample (N=59), suggesting the original study was underpowered. The p‑value (calculated from the F-statistic to be p≈.011) is significant but not highly compelling. This combination of a small effect, small sample, and a p-value in the ambiguous .01 range makes a successful replication unlikely, as the original result may have been a false positive or an overestimation of a true but tiny effect.
---
0.35
The primary reason for the low prediction is the combination of a small sample size (N=59) and a very small reported effect size (η² = .02). This suggests the original study was severely underpowered, making the statistically significant result (p ≈ .01) likely to be an overestimate and difficult to detect reliably in a new sample. While the author is well-cited and the analysis is simple, these statistical shortcomings are strong predictors of replication failure.
---
0.82
This prediction is high because the paper reports a series of five studies on a robust cognitive phenomenon, suggesting the finding is internally replicated. The reported F-statistic corresponds to a medium-to-large effect size, which is a strong positive predictor of replication success. However, the probability is not higher because the individual study’s sample size is small and its p-value (p≈.01) is not overwhelmingly low, creating some risk that the true effect is smaller than originally observed.
---
0.72
This study has a high predicted replication success because it reports a series of five studies on a robust cognitive phenomenon, and the provided test statistic indicates a moderately strong effect (p≈.01). While the sample size is small and a reporting inconsistency exists, the internal replication across multiple experiments is a very strong indicator of a reliable finding. The strength of the multi-study design outweighs the risk associated with the small sample."

The probability of replication is low primarily due to the statistical analysis. The reported test statistic, F(1, 9) = 8.7, indicates that the analysis was likely based on the 11 items rather than the 141 participants, making it severely underpowered. Although the reported effect size is very large (r = -0.7), such strong effects found in low-power studies are often inflated due to sampling error and are consequently less stable and harder to replicate.
---
0.35
The primary concern is the very low degrees of freedom for the error term in the ANOVA (df=9), which sharply contrasts with the large participant sample size (N=141). This suggests the statistical test was based on a small number of items (N≈10) rather than participants, making the analysis underpowered and the result less generalizable. This weakness, combined with a p-value just below the .05 threshold, suggests the large reported effect size (r=-0.7) may be an overestimation, lowering the likelihood of a successful replication.
---
0.35
The primary weakness of this study is the statistical analysis. The F-statistic's degrees of freedom (1, 9) suggest the analysis was conducted on the 11 items rather than the 141 participants, resulting in a very small effective sample size. While the reported effect size is large, such effects found in small samples are often overestimated and tend to be smaller in replications. Therefore, despite a plausible hypothesis and a good number of participants, the statistical evidence is weak, making a successful replication less likely.
---
0.3
The primary concern is the extremely low error degrees of freedom (df=9) in the ANOVA, which is inconsistent with the large sample size of 141 participants. This suggests the analysis was performed on a small number of highly aggregated data points, making the finding statistically fragile despite the large reported effect size. A p-value that is significant but not overwhelmingly so (calculated as p≈.016) further reduces confidence in the stability of this result.
---
0.82
The prediction is high due to the very large reported effect size (r = -0.7) and a solid sample size (N=141) for a lab-based cognitive study. Although the p-value is reported inexactly, the F-statistic (F(1,9)=8.7) corresponds to a p-value of .016, which is not borderline. The study tests a well-established cognitive phenomenon (truth-bias), and the unusual degrees of freedom suggest a rigorous item-level analysis, both of which bolster confidence in the finding's robustness.
---
0.25
The low replication probability is driven by a critical flaw in the reported statistics. The degrees of freedom for the F-test (df2 = 9) are far too low for a study with 141 participants, suggesting an incorrect analysis that likely ignored subject-level variance and dramatically inflated the evidence. This statistical error almost certainly explains the reported effect size (r = -0.7), which is improbably large for this area of research and is unlikely to be reproduced in a replication using a more appropriate mixed-effects model."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
Personal predictions are often optimistically biased. This simple observation has troubling implications for psychologists, economists, and decision theorists concerned with rationality and the accuracy of self-knowledge (Armor & Taylor, 2002; Krizan & Windschitl, 2007; Sweeny, Carroll, & Shepperd, 2006). However, normative conclusions about the impropriety of optimistic bias rest on an untested assumption: that people desire to be accurate when making personal predictions. If people believe, rightly or wrongly, that unrealistic optimism has some value, then optimistic bias may be usefully understood as being consistent with people's values and beliefs.

Key details:
- Sample size: 125
- Analysis type (e.g. rm ANOVA, mixed ANOVA, regression, t‑test): single sample t-test
- Test statistic: t(124) =10.36

The prediction is very high due to the extremely large effect size (d = .93) and the correspondingly strong statistical evidence (t(124) = 10.36), which would produce a p-value far below .001. This powerful signal, coupled with a simple analysis (single-sample t-test) and a sufficient sample size, makes the original finding very likely to be robust and replicable.

0.92
The reported effect size is very large (d = 0.93) and the statistical evidence is extremely strong (t = 10.36, implying a p-value far below .001), making the finding highly robust. This strong signal, combined with an adequate sample size (N = 125) and a simple, transparent analysis (single-sample t-test), suggests a very high probability of successful replication. Even if the original effect is slightly inflated, a replication attempt would almost certainly detect a substantial effect.
---
0.92
The reported statistical evidence is exceptionally strong, with a very large effect size (d = 0.93) and an extremely low p-value (inferred from the high t‑statistic). This robust finding, combined with a straightforward single-sample t-test analysis that limits researcher flexibility and a decent sample size, suggests the effect is reliable and highly likely to replicate.

0.94
The reported statistical evidence is exceptionally strong, featuring a very large effect size (d = .93) and a correspondingly high test statistic (t = 10.36), which implies an extremely small p‑value. This powerful signal, detected with a decent sample size and a simple analysis, suggests the finding is highly robust and not an artifact of chance or complex modeling. Therefore, a direct replication of this core effect is very likely to succeed.
---
0.92
The prediction is high due to the exceptionally strong statistical evidence; the very large effect size (d = .93) and extremely significant p-value (inferred from the t‑statistic of 10.36) are the best predictors of a successful replication. This confidence is further bolstered by the simple, transparent analysis (a single sample t-test) and a respectable sample size. While social psychology has historically shown lower replication rates, the overwhelming strength of these specific metrics suggests the finding is highly robust.
---
0.92
The probability of replication is very high, driven primarily by the extremely strong statistical evidence: the large effect size (d = .93) and the correspondingly low p-value (implied by t(124) = 10.36). This strong signal is bolstered by a simple, robust analysis (single-sample t-test) and an adequate sample size, minimizing concerns about statistical artifacts. These factors combined suggest a highly robust finding."

The extremely strong evidence, including a very low p-value (p < .001, derived from the F-statistic) and a large effect size (ηp² = 0.326), strongly suggests the effect is real and would replicate. Furthermore, the study builds on established theory and internally replicates a known finding, which boosts confidence. The primary risk factor is the very small sample size (N=32), which can lead to unstable and inflated effect size estimates; however, the signal reported here is so strong it is likely to persist even with some expected shrinkage of the effect in a replication.
---
0.88
The prediction is high due to the very strong statistical evidence (F(1,30) = 14.49, p < .001; ηp² = .326) and the fact that the study logically extends a well-established finding in cognitive aging by an experienced author. However, the small sample size (N=32) is a significant caveat, as such studies can produce inflated effect size estimates, slightly reducing certainty. A replication is nonetheless very likely to find a significant effect, even if its magnitude is smaller.
---
0.82
The reported effect size is very large (ηp² = .326) and the corresponding p-value is highly significant, which strongly favors successful replication. Although the small sample size (N=32) is a notable weakness that can lead to inflated effect estimates, this risk is somewhat mitigated by the study's strong theoretical basis. The finding is a plausible extension of a well-established effect in cognitive aging, making a true underlying effect—and thus a successful replication—highly probable.
---
0.85
This study has a high likelihood of replication due to its very strong statistical evidence, including a very low p-value (corresponding to the F-statistic) and a large effect size (__p^2 = 0.326). While the sample size is small, which can lead to overestimated effects, the signal here is so strong that the core finding is likely to be robust. Furthermore, the hypothesis is a direct, plausible extension of previously replicated findings in the field of cognitive aging.
---
0.78
The reported effect size is very large (__p^2 = 0.326) and the p‑value is highly significant, which strongly favors replicability. Although the small sample size (N=32) is a major weakness and risks inflating the effect, the finding is a plausible extension of a previously established phenomenon in cognitive aging. The high author citation count and the nature of the cognitive subfield also provide some confidence in the result.
---
0.75
This study has a very strong statistical signal, with an extremely low p-value (p < .001, inferred from the F-statistic) and a large effect size, making a replication likely. However, the primary weakness is the very small sample size (N=32), which can produce unstable estimates and inflate effect sizes. The probability is therefore high but not certain, as the strong signal must be weighed against the risk posed by the small sample."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
When learning new words, do children use a speaker's eye gaze because it reveals referential intent? We conducted two experiments that addressed this question. In Experiment 1, the experimenter left while two novel objects were placed where the child could see both, but the experimenter would be able to see only one. The experimenter returned, looked directly at the mutually visible object, and said either, ""There's the [novel word]!"" or ""Where's the [novel word]?""

This prediction balances the study's primary strength against its main weakness. The key positive indicator is the strong statistical evidence; the reported test statistic (t(31)=3.23) corresponds to a p-value of approximately .003, which is a robust predictor of replication. However, the very small sample size (N=32) is a major risk factor, as such studies can produce unstable and inflated effect size estimates, making replication less certain.
---
0.72
The reported statistics show a strong signal, with a p‑value of approximately .003 (calculated from the t‑statistic) and a moderate effect size (d = .57). While the small sample size (N=32) is a significant concern and increases the risk of an inflated effect, this is partly offset by the use of a powerful within‑subjects design (dependent t‑test). The straightforward analysis and the plausibility of the finding in a classic area of developmental psychology suggest a good chance of successful replication.
---
0.75
The study's low p‑value (corresponding to t=3.23) and medium effect size (d=.571) are strong positive predictors of replicability. The use of a simple dependent t‑test also reduces concerns about analytical flexibility. The primary risk factor is the small sample size (N=32), which increases the possibility that the observed effect is an overestimate and may not be detected in a replication attempt.
---
0.68
This prediction balances the study's primary strength against its main weakness. The low p-value (p≈.003, derived from the t-statistic) is a strong positive predictor of replicability. However, the small sample size (N=32) is a significant concern, as it can produce unstable and inflated effect size estimates. The straightforward analysis and theoretically plausible finding are positives, but the risk associated with the small sample tempers the overall confidence.
---
0.62
While the reported p-value is very low (p≈.003 based on the t-statistic), suggesting a robust finding, the small sample size (N=32) is a major concern for replicability, as it can produce inflated effect sizes. The study's subfield (developmental psychology) and reliance on experimenter-child interaction can also introduce variability that makes direct replication challenging. These negative factors temper the confidence warranted by the strong p-value.
---
0.68
The reported p-value is strong for the sample size (t(31)=3.23 implies p≈.003), and the dependent t-test is a simple analysis, both of which are positive signs for replicability. However, the small sample of 32 means the medium effect size (d=.57) is likely inflated and the study has low statistical power, which is the primary risk factor. While there is likely a real effect, a replication's success is uncertain due to the imprecision of the original estimate."

The probability of replication is high due to strong statistical evidence (p<.01, t=3.94) from a respectable sample size (N=173) for this type of study. The finding, while counter‑intuitive, is supported by a moderate effect size (d=0.47) and relies on a simple, robust analysis (dependent t‑test), which reduces the likelihood of spurious results from analytical flexibility. The straightforward, within‑subjects cognitive task further increases confidence in the stability of the effect.
---
0.92
The reported statistical evidence is strong, with a p-value much lower than the reported <.01 threshold (t(172)=3.94 corresponds to p≈.0001) and a medium effect size (d=0.47). The use of a simple, powerful within-subjects design (dependent t-test) with an adequate sample size further increases confidence. The cognitive finding itself is plausible and builds on established statistical principles, making it highly likely to replicate.
---
0.88
This study is highly likely to replicate due to its strong p-value (<.01), reasonably large sample size for the subfield (N=173), and a simple, transparent analysis (dependent t-test) which limits analytical flexibility. Although the reported effect size (d=0.47) appears inconsistent with the t-statistic and sample size, the overall statistical evidence for the effect is robust. The underlying cognitive phenomenon is well-established and the design is straightforward, further increasing the probability of a successful replication.
---
0.75
The study reports a strong p-value (<.01) with an adequate sample size (N=173) for a simple within-subjects design, which are positive indicators for replication. However, there is a significant inconsistency between the reported test statistic (t=3.94) and the effect size (d=0.47), which would correspond to a t-value of over 6.0. This reporting error raises concerns and suggests the true effect is likely smaller than claimed, thus lowering the probability of a successful replication.
---
0.70
The prediction is moderately high due to the strong statistical evidence (t=3.94, p<.01) and the simple, plausible within-subjects design. However, confidence is tempered by a notable inconsistency between the reported effect size (d=0.47) and the one implied by the t‑statistic and sample size (d≈0.30). This discrepancy, along with the study's connection to the social psychology subfield, raises the risk that a replication attempt could be underpowered and thus fail to find the effect.
---
0.88
The reported p-value is very low (well below .01), supported by a strong test statistic and a decent sample size for a powerful within-subjects design. The analysis is a simple t-test, which reduces the likelihood of inflated results from analytical complexity. Combined with a medium effect size and a plausible cognitive mechanism, these factors suggest a high probability of replication success."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
How does temporal selection work, and along what dimensions does it vary from one instance to the next? We explored these questions using a phenomenon in which temporal selection goes awry. In the attentional blink, subjects fail to report the second of a pair of targets (T1 and T2) when they are presented at stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs) of roughly 200 to 500 ms. We directly tested the properties of temporal selection during the blink by analyzing distractor intrusions at a fast rate of item presentation. Our analysis shows that attentional selection is (a) suppressed, (b) delayed, and (c) diffused in time during the attentional blink. These effects are dissociated by their time course: The measure of each effect returns to the baseline value at a different SOA. Our results constrain theories of the attentional blink and indicate that temporal selection varies along at least three dissociable dimensions: efficacy, latency, and precision.

This study has an extremely high likelihood of replication due to its very large effect size (ηp² = .308) and exceptionally low p‑value (<.00001). While the sample size is small, the study uses a within‑subjects ANOVA with many observations per subject (implied by the large error degrees of freedom), which is a powerful design common in cognitive psychology for robust phenomena like the attentional blink. The combination of powerful statistical evidence and a strong, well‑established experimental paradigm makes the core finding highly likely to be replicable.
---
0.88
The prediction is high due to overwhelming statistical evidence, including an extremely small p-value and a very large effect size, suggesting a strong and easily detectable signal. Although the sample size is very small, the study is a within‑subjects design in cognitive psychology, a subfield with a higher historical replication rate where small samples with many trials can have high statistical power. The study investigates a well‑established, robust phenomenon (the attentional blink), further increasing confidence in the finding.
---
0.85
The reported p‑value is extremely low (<.00001) and the effect size is very large (ηp^2 = .308), both of which are strong positive predictors of replicability. Although the sample size of 12 is very small, this is a within‑subjects cognitive study where many trials per participant can provide high statistical power to detect robust effects like the attentional blink. Given the overwhelming strength of the statistical evidence, the main finding is very likely to replicate, even if the effect size is somewhat smaller in a new sample.
---
0.82
The extremely strong statistical evidence, including a very low p‑value (p<.00001) and a large effect size (ηp² = .308), suggests a robust finding. While the small sample size (N=12) is a major concern that increases the risk of an overestimated effect, this is partially offset by the powerful within‑subjects design and the study's foundation in the well‑established attentional blink phenomenon. Therefore, a successful replication is highly probable, even if the observed effect size is smaller.
---
0.92
This study has a very high probability of replicating successfully due to its extremely large effect size (partial η² = .308) and a correspondingly tiny p-value, indicating a powerful and statistically robust finding. While the sample size of 12 is small, this is a common characteristic for within‑subjects cognitive paradigms like the attentional blink, where high statistical power is achieved through many repeated trials per participant (as implied by the large denominator degrees of freedom in the F‑test). Investigating a well-established phenomenon in a highly controlled experimental setting further bolsters confidence in the result.
---
0.92
Despite a small sample size, the study has a very high replication likelihood due to the extremely strong evidence and the nature of the research area. The reported p-value is exceptionally low (<.00001) and the effect size is massive (partial eta-squared = .308), indicating a very robust finding. Furthermore, studies on the attentional blink, a classic cognitive phenomenon, often use within-subjects designs with many trials, making them powerful and reliable even with few participants."

The study tests the glucose model of self-control, a theory notorious for failed replications, which is the strongest predictor of a low replication rate. Furthermore, the reported test statistic yields a p-value of .023, which is close to the significance threshold and often associated with lower replicability. The small effect size (ηp² = .045) combined with these factors suggests the original finding is unlikely to be successfully replicated.
---
0.12
The study's hypothesis, that glucose consumption reverses ""ego depletion"" effects, comes from a subfield of social psychology that has suffered a severe replication crisis. The statistical evidence is also weak: the F-statistic corresponds to a p-value just below .05 (p≈.023) and the effect size is small (ηp²=.045). These factors, combined with the theoretical controversy, suggest that an independent replication is highly unlikely to succeed.
---
0.15
This prediction is low primarily because the study tests the glucose model of ego depletion, a specific hypothesis within social psychology that has performed very poorly in large-scale replication projects. Although the sample size is moderate, the reported effect size is small (__p^2 = .045) and the p-value (calculated from the F-statistic to be approximately .023) is close to the conventional .05 threshold, both of which are markers of lower replicability. The combination of a theoretically fragile topic and non-robust statistical evidence suggests a low probability of successful replication.

The prediction is low primarily because the study tests the glucose model of ego depletion, a theory that has performed very poorly in large-scale replication attempts. This theoretical weakness is compounded by marginal statistical evidence: the p-value (calculated as p≈.023 from the F-statistic) is close to the .05 threshold and the effect size is modest (ηp² = .045), suggesting the original finding may not be robust. The complexity of the proposed causal chain—from sugar, to blood glucose, to self-control resources, to decision-making strategy—also makes the effect less likely to be replicated.

0.15
The study's hypothesis relies on the ""ego depletion"" model of self-control, a theory that has performed very poorly in large-scale replication attempts. While the sample size is moderate, the p-value is close to the .05 threshold (F(1, 111) = 5.311 corresponds to p ≈ .023) and the effect size is small, suggesting the result is not robust. These factors, combined with the study's origin in social psychology, a subfield with known replication challenges for such complex interaction effects, indicate a low probability of success.
---
0.20
The reported p-value (approx. .023) is close to the significance threshold and the effect size is small, indicating the study may be underpowered to reliably detect such an effect. Most importantly, the study's topic—the glucose model of self-control and ego depletion—is part of a literature that has famously performed very poorly in large-scale, pre-registered replication attempts. The combination of borderline statistical evidence and a theoretically challenged hypothesis makes a successful replication unlikely."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
The error-related negativity (ERN) is a negative deflection in the event-related potential that is maximal approximately 50 ms after the commission of an error. The ERN is generated in the anterior cingulate cortex, a region of the medial prefrontal cortex implicated in both cognitive and emotional processing. Affective and motivational variables influence the magnitude of the ERN, which suggests that the ERN may relate to emotional or motivational aspects of error detection. In the present study, we evaluated the possibility that errors prime defensive motivational responses, and that the ERN may predict the magnitude of defensive reactivity after errors. We found that (a) the defensive startle response was larger following errors than following correct responses, and (b) the magnitude of the ERN predicted the degree of startle potentiation following errors.

Compared to other psychology studies, consider how the combination of sample size, p-value, effect size, statistical method complexity, first author citation count, and subfield influences replication likelihood. Provide a probability between 0 and 1 on the first line, then give a concise 2–3 sentence rationale that reflects this comparative judgment.",0.25,0.28,0.32,0.35,0.35,0.35,0.3166666667,"0.25
The replication probability is low primarily due to the combination of a small sample size (N=31) and a p-value just below the .05 significance threshold. This combination suggests that the reported medium effect size (r=-.38) is likely an overestimate and the finding is statistically fragile, with a high chance of being a false positive. A well-powered replication would likely find a substantially smaller and non-significant effect.
---
0.28
The prediction is low primarily due to the small sample size (N=31) and the p-value being just below the conventional significance threshold of .05. This combination suggests the study was underpowered and the reported medium effect size (r = -.38) is likely an overestimation, with a wide confidence interval that barely excludes zero. Although the analysis is straightforward, the statistical evidence is weak, lowering the likelihood of a successful replication.
---
0.32
The prediction is low primarily due to the combination of a small sample size (N=31) and a p-value just under the conventional significance threshold of .05. This suggests the reported effect size (r=-.38) is likely an overestimation with a wide confidence interval, increasing the chance that a replication attempt would yield a non-significant result. While the author is well-established, the study is statistically underpowered, which is a strong negative predictor for replicability.
---
0.35
The prediction is low primarily due to the small sample size (N=31) for a correlational analysis, which provides low statistical power and yields a very imprecise effect size estimate. The reported p-value of <.05, when combined with a medium effect size (r=-.38) and a small sample, suggests the result is statistically significant but not overwhelmingly so, increasing the chance it may be a false positive or an overestimation. While the author is well-established and the analysis is simple, these factors do not fully mitigate the statistical weakness of the original evidence.
---
0.35
The primary reasons for this low prediction are the small sample size (N=31) and a p-value just under the .05 threshold, which suggests the finding is statistically fragile. The observed medium effect size (r = -.38) is likely an overestimation, and its confidence interval is wide and barely excludes zero. While the correlational analysis is straightforward, the weak statistical power of the original study makes a successful replication improbable.
---
0.35
The primary concerns are the small sample size (N=31) and the marginal p-value, which was likely just below the .05 threshold. This combination results in low statistical power and suggests the reported effect size (r=-.38) may be inflated, making a successful replication challenging. While the use of a simple correlation and physiological measures are positive signs, the statistical weakness of the original evidence is the dominant consideration."

The predicted probability is low primarily due to the extremely small sample size (N=12), which provides a very unstable foundation for the findings. While the reported effect size is exceptionally large, such estimates from underpowered studies are often severely inflated and likely to be much smaller in a replication attempt. These critical limitations overshadow the reported statistical significance (a very high t-value) and simple analysis type.

The primary negative factor is the extremely small sample size (N=12), which is common in early fMRI studies but provides low statistical power and highly unstable estimates. This likely led to a massively inflated effect size estimate (d=3.25), a phenomenon known as the ""winner's curse."" While the corresponding p‑value is very strong, a well‑powered replication is almost certain to find a much smaller effect that may not reach statistical significance.

The primary risk to replicability is the extremely small sample size (N=12), which is common in costly fMRI studies but can produce highly unstable and inflated results. However, the reported effect size (d=3.25) and corresponding t‑statistic are exceptionally large, suggesting a very strong signal that is likely to be detected again, even if the true effect is smaller. The simple statistical analysis (t-test) is a positive sign, but the result's robustness is tempered by the low power of the original study design.

The extremely small sample size (n=12) makes the results highly unreliable, despite the very low p‑value. The reported effect size (d=3.25) is astronomically large and almost certainly inflated, a common issue in underpowered studies known as the ""winner's curse."" An independent replication, particularly with a more adequate sample size, would likely find a much smaller or non‑significant effect.

0.25
The probability of successful replication is very low primarily due to the extremely small sample size (n=12), which provides very little statistical power and produces unstable estimates. The resulting effect size (d=3.25) is so large that it is almost certainly an overestimation that would shrink dramatically in a larger replication attempt. While the p-value is significant, this is less meaningful given the other metrics, and the study's subfield and use of complex fMRI methods are also associated with historical replication challenges.
---
0.62
The reported p-value is extremely low (corresponding to t(11)=5.39) and the effect size is massive, both of which strongly predict a successful replication. However, the sample size is exceptionally small (n=12), which makes the estimates highly uncertain and likely to be inflated, a known issue in early fMRI studies. Therefore, while the statistical signal is very strong, the weakness of the sample substantially lowers confidence in a successful replication."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
The representation of visual information inside the focus of attention is more precise than the representation of information outside the focus of attention. We found that the visual system can compensate for the cost of withdrawing attention by pooling noisy local features and computing summary statistics. The location of an individual object is a local feature, whereas the center of mass of several objects (centroid) is a summary feature representing the mean object location. Three experiments showed that withdrawing attention degraded the representation of individual positions more than the representation of the centroid. It appears that information outside the focus of attention can be represented at an abstract level that lacks local detail, but nevertheless carries a precise statistical summary of the scene. The term ensemble features refers to a broad class of statistical summary features that we propose collectively make up the representation of information outside the focus of attention.

The primary concern for replication is the extremely small sample size (N=8), which produces unstable results and low statistical power. While the reported effect size is very large, the estimate from such a small sample is unreliable and likely inflated. The p-value of 0.028 is also close to the conventional significance threshold, increasing the risk that the original finding was a false positive.

This study has a very high risk of non-replication due to its extremely small sample size (N=8) and a p-value (0.028) that is only barely below the conventional significance threshold. While the reported effect size is large, such estimates are highly unreliable and often inflated in underpowered studies. A replication attempt would likely find a smaller, non-significant effect.

This prediction is low primarily due to the extremely small sample size (N=8), which yields low statistical power and highly uncertain estimates. Although the reported effect size is very large, it is likely inflated, and the p-value of 0.028 is close enough to the significance threshold to suggest the result may not be robust. While the simple t-test and within-subjects design are positives, the statistical evidence is too fragile to warrant high confidence in a successful replication.

0.35
The primary concern is the extremely small sample size of eight participants, which provides very low statistical power and produces an unstable estimate. A p-value of 0.028 is only weakly significant and has a low probability of replicating. While the reported effect size is very large, such estimates from underpowered studies are often inflated, meaning the true effect is likely much smaller and the original finding has a high risk of being a Type I error.

0.35
The primary reason for the low predicted success rate is the extremely small sample size (N=8), which yields low statistical power and unstable estimates. While the reported effect size is very large, such estimates are often inflated in small samples, and the p-value (0.028) is close enough to the 0.05 threshold to be considered fragile. Although the study uses a simple analysis and is in a subfield (cognitive) with some robust findings, the statistical evidence from this specific experiment is too weak to be confident in its replicability.
---
0.32
The predicted probability is low primarily due to the extremely small sample size (N=8) and a p-value (0.028) that is just below the standard significance threshold. This combination suggests the study had very low power, and the large observed effect size is likely a substantial overestimation of the true effect. Although the simple analysis and cognitive paradigm are positive indicators, the weak statistical evidence makes a successful replication unlikely."

The primary reason for the low replication estimate is the extremely small sample size (N=36), which makes the finding unstable and prone to false positives, even with a conventionally significant p-value (the F-statistic corresponds to p ≈ .02). While the reported effect size is large, it is likely inflated, a common artifact of underpowered studies. Furthermore, complex social-psychological manipulations like inducing a ""threat to the system"" are often sensitive to context and have historically shown lower rates of successful replication.
---
0.25
This prediction is low due to several high-risk factors. The sample size (N=36) is extremely small for this type of design, which makes the results less stable and suggests the large reported effect size is likely inflated. Furthermore, the F‑statistic corresponds to a p‑value of approximately 0.02, a value that is statistically significant but not strong enough to overcome the concerns raised by the low power of the study.
---
0.22
The study has an extremely small sample size (N=36) for a between‑subjects design, which results in very low statistical power and makes the findings highly susceptible to sampling error. Although the result was significant, the p-value is not very low (p≈.02, based on the F-statistic), and the large observed effect size is likely substantially inflated. Studies in social psychology with subtle experimental manipulations and small samples have historically shown low rates of successful replication.
---
0.25
This study’s very small sample size (N=36) provides low statistical power and increases the likelihood that the observed large effect size (ηp² = 0.147) is an overestimate. The p-value, inferred from the F-statistic to be approximately .02, falls into a range that has demonstrated lower replication success rates. The combination of a small sample and a p-value close to the significance threshold makes a successful replication unlikely.

The prediction is low primarily due to the extremely small sample size (N=36), which provides low statistical power and makes the findings less stable. The resulting p-value (p≈.02, inferred from the F-statistic) is significant but not highly convincing, while the large effect size is likely an overestimation common in underpowered studies. These statistical weaknesses, combined with the study’s subfield (social psychology) which has historically lower replication rates for subtle manipulations, suggest a low probability of a successful replication.

The primary concern for replication is the very small sample size (N=36), which provides low statistical power and can produce unstable, inflated effect size estimates.

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
A photograph of an action can convey a vivid sense of motion. Does the inference of motion from viewing a photograph involve the same neural and psychological representations used when one views physical motion? In this study, we tested whether implied motion is represented by the same direction-selective signals involved in the perception of real motion. We made use of the motion aftereffect, a visual motion illusion. Three experiments showed that viewing a series of static photographs with implied motion in a particular direction produced motion aftereffects in the opposite direction, as assessed with real-motion test probes. The transfer of adaptation from motion depicted in photographs to real motion demonstrates that the perception of implied motion activates direction-selective circuits that are also involved in processing real motion.

Compared to other psychology studies, consider how the combination of sample size, p-value, effect size, statistical method complexity, first author citation count, and subfield influences replication likelihood.

The extremely low p-value and large effect size (d = -0.94) are strong indicators of a robust finding, significantly increasing the likelihood of replication. This is further supported by the use of a simple paired t-test in a within-subjects design to study a perceptual phenomenon, which often yields reliable effects. While the sample size is small, the sheer strength of the reported signal makes a successful replication highly probable.
---
0.92
The extremely small p-value (p < .0001) and large effect size (d = -0.94) provide very strong evidence for the reported effect. This finding is further bolstered by its basis in a basic perceptual phenomenon investigated with a simple and powerful within-subjects design. While the sample size is modest, the strength of the statistical signal suggests the effect is robust and highly likely to replicate.
---
0.92
This study has an extremely high probability of replication due to its very strong statistical evidence, including a p-value far below the standard threshold and a large effect size (d = -0.94). The simple, low-flexibility analysis (paired t-test) and its basis in cognitive perception—a subfield with typically robust findings—further bolster confidence. The modest sample size is not a major concern given the strength of these other factors.

The prediction for high replication success is driven by the very small p-value (p < .0001) and large effect size (d = -0.94), which are strong positive indicators. The study also uses a simple, powerful within-subjects design and straightforward analysis (t-test) to investigate a basic cognitive-perceptual phenomenon, a research area that tends to replicate well. While the sample size is modest, the strength of the statistical evidence suggests a robust finding.

The prediction is high due to the very small p-value and large effect size, which are strong indicators of a robust finding. While the sample size is modest, the study uses a simple analysis (paired t-test) and investigates a core perceptual phenomenon, which generally has a higher replication rate than more complex social psychology topics. The strength of the statistical evidence significantly outweighs the potential concern of the smaller sample.

A successful replication is highly likely given the combination of an extremely low p-value and a large effect size (d = -0.94), which are the strongest predictors of replicability. The study uses a simple analysis (paired t-test) and a powerful within-subjects design to investigate a cognitive perception phenomenon, a subfield known for more robust effects. While the sample size is modest, the strength of the statistical evidence strongly suggests a real and easily detectable effect."

This study has a very low probability of successful replication due to several critical weaknesses. The sample size (N=28) is extremely small, which produces unstable estimates and increases the likelihood of a chance finding. Most importantly, the key test statistic (F(1, 26) = 4.17) corresponds to a p-value of .051, which fails to meet the conventional threshold for statistical significance, and the use of the 'prep' statistic is an outdated practice often used to obscure non-significant results. The large reported effect size is likely an overestimation, a common artifact in small, underpowered studies.
---
0.15
This study has a very low probability of replication due to multiple red flags. The sample size (N=28) is extremely small for a complex mixed-ANOVA design, resulting in low statistical power and noisy estimates. Crucially, the reported F-statistic corresponds to a p-value of approximately .051, which is not significant; the authors’ choice to report the obscure “prep” metric instead suggests an attempt to mask this weak evidence. While the reported effect size is large, such effects found in underpowered studies are often highly inflated and unlikely to be reproduced in a replication attempt with a larger sample.
---
0.15
This prediction is very low due to a convergence of major statistical weaknesses. The sample size is extremely small for a complex mixed ANOVA, leading to very low statistical power and a likely inflated effect size. Most critically, the reported test statistic F(1, 26) = 4.17 corresponds to a p-value of p ≈ .051, and the authors' choice to report the nonstandard `prep` statistic suggests this marginally significant result would be difficult to replicate.
---
0.20
The prediction is low due to several statistical weaknesses. The sample size (N=28) is extremely small, providing very low statistical power and increasing the likelihood of an inflated effect size or a false positive. The reported test statistic corresponds to a p-value of approximately .051, which is not statistically significant and represents very weak evidence, while the finding itself is a complex interaction that is inherently difficult to replicate.
---
0.15
This study has a very low probability of successful replication due to multiple strong risk factors. The sample size is extremely small (N=28), which makes the study underpowered and the reported large effect size likely inflated. The test statistic yields a p-value of approximately .051, a marginal result that is a strong predictor of replication failure, and the key finding is a complex interaction which is typically less robust than a simple main effect.
---
0.15
The extremely low sample size (N=28) makes the large reported effect size likely to be inflated and the finding statistically fragile. Furthermore, the test statistic (F=4.17) corresponds to a p-value just over the .05 significance threshold, a classic indicator of a finding that is difficult to replicate. The study's complexity, testing for a specific three-way interaction, further decreases the likelihood of a successful replication."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
In the experiment reported here, we used eye movement recordings to investigate the phenomenon from the perspective of the people looking at the offended bystander. Our findings point toward the function of this behavior, and reveal the surprising depth of cognitive processing that is engaged by social interaction. Twenty-five non-Black undergraduates participated in the study, during which they watched a prerecorded video. In the video, the discussants were instructed to give their thoughts on the university's admissions policies. The first White discussant responded that the university should consider having admission interviews. The second White discussant criticized affirmative action in a way that was potentially offensive. Whereas the association hypothesis predicted that the Black individual would be looked at more than the available White discussants in both conditions, the social-referencing hypothesis predicted this response only in the headphones-on condition, when he could hear the remark and have a potentially informative reaction. From a cognitive perspective, the results reveal that participants simultaneously attend to what is said, who can hear what is said, the social identity of the listeners, and the possible reactions of the listeners, corroborating recent findings that eye movements are influenced by a range of subtle linguistic and interpersonal factors. From a social perspective, the finding that the reactions of minority-group members are sought out by observers raises important questions about the function of this behavior.

The primary reason for this low prediction is the very small sample size (N=25), which increases the likelihood that the reported large effect size is inflated and the finding is not robust. While the p-value is low, results from underpowered studies are often unstable and less likely to replicate successfully. The complexity of the social interaction being measured may also be sensitive to subtle variations in the experimental setup, further challenging replication.
---
0.45
The primary concern for replication is the very small sample size (N=25), which increases the likelihood of an inflated effect size and a spurious result. Although the reported p-value is low (<.005) and the effect size is large (__p^2=.18), these metrics are less trustworthy with such a small sample. A well-powered replication would likely observe a smaller effect, thus lowering the chances of a statistically significant success.
---
0.35
The reported p-value is low and the effect size is large, which are positive indicators. However, the extremely small sample size (N=25) is a major weakness, as such studies are prone to finding inflated effects that are not robust. Given the complexity of the mixed ANOVA, a well‑powered replication would likely find a much smaller, potentially non‑significant effect.
---
0.35
The primary concern is the very small sample size (N=25), which makes the study severely underpowered and increases the likelihood of a false positive. Although the reported p-value is low (<.005) and the effect size is large (ηp² = .18), such impressive results from small samples are often statistically inflated and tend to shrink or disappear in higher-powered replications. The complexity of the social phenomenon and analysis may also pose challenges for a successful replication.
---
0.35
The prediction is low primarily due to the very small sample size (N=25), which suggests the study is underpowered and the large reported effect size (__p^2 = .18) is likely an overestimation. While the strong p‑value (<.005) and the use of a powerful within‑subjects design are positive indicators, they are overshadowed by the high risk of a false positive associated with small samples in a subfield like social psychology.
---
0.45
The very small sample size (N=25) is the primary concern, as it provides low statistical power and increases the likelihood of an inflated effect size estimate. Although the low p-value (<.005) and large effect size are positive indicators, such strong results from underpowered studies are often not stable. The study's focus on a subtle social interaction using a moderately complex analysis also suggests the finding may be fragile."

This study uses a powerful within-subjects design and reports a very large effect size, both of which favor replicability. However, the extremely small sample size (N=24) and a p-value that is likely just under .05 are significant weaknesses that increase the chance of a false positive or an inflated effect size. A successful replication is plausible, but the finding's stability is questionable.
---
0.65
This prediction is moderately high because the study reports a large effect size (ηp² = .20) within a powerful repeated-measures design, suggesting a robust phenomenon. However, confidence is significantly tempered by the very small sample size (N=24) and a p-value (calculated as p ≈ .025 from the F-statistic) that is not overwhelmingly strong. These weaknesses suggest the effect size may be overestimated and introduce notable uncertainty about replication success, as small samples can produce unstable results.
---
0.85
This prediction is high due to the very large reported effect size (partial η² = .20) and the use of a standard, within-subjects cognitive paradigm, which is generally straightforward to replicate. While the small sample size (N=24) and corresponding p-value (p≈.025) introduce some uncertainty about the precision of the original estimate, an effect of this magnitude has a high probability of being detected in a replication attempt.
---
0.75
The study's primary weakness is a very small sample size, which increases the risk that the significant result (with a p-value of ~.025, close to the .05 threshold) is a false positive or an overestimate. However, this is counterbalanced by a very large reported effect size (ηp² = .20) and a straightforward, within-subjects experimental design typical of cognitive psychology. The sheer magnitude of the effect suggests it is robust enough to likely be detected again in a replication attempt, even if the true effect is smaller.
---
0.45
The study's primary weakness is its very small sample size (N=24), which increases the likelihood of finding a spurious result and of overestimating the true effect size. Although the reported effect size (ηp² = .20) is large, such findings from underpowered studies are often inflated and less likely to replicate. The p-value, while significant, is likely not far below the .05 threshold, further reducing confidence in the stability of the finding.

0.72
The study reports a very large effect size (ηp² = .20) within a powerful repeated-measures design, which are strong positive predictors for replication success, especially for a cognitive psychology paradigm. However, the extremely small sample size (N=24) and a p-value that is significant but not far from the .05 threshold suggest the effect size may be inflated and introduce notable uncertainty. Overall, the strength of the experimental design for this type of effect outweighs the statistical weakness of the small sample, making replication likely but not certain."

To quantify how much people had what they wanted, we identified how much they wanted and whether or not they had each item. Both variables accounted for unique variance in happiness. Moreover, the extent to which people wanted what they had partially mediated effects of gratitude and maximization on happiness, and the extent to which they had what they wanted partially mediated the effect of maximization.

The study's low power, resulting from a combination of a small sample size (N=119) and a small effect size (pr=.21), suggests the finding may be unstable. The reported `prep` value corresponds to a p-value just under the .05 threshold, and such ""just significant"" results have been shown to have lower replication rates. While the survey-based design is straightforward to replicate, the statistical weakness of the original evidence makes a successful replication less likely.
---
0.35
This prediction is low due to several statistical weaknesses. The sample size (N=119) is small for a correlational study, and the effect size is also small (pr=.21), suggesting the study may have been underpowered and the reported effect could be an overestimation. Furthermore, the use of `prep`=.92 corresponds to a p-value of approximately .046; such ""p-just-below-.05"" results have been shown to have a low rate of successful replication.
---
0.35
The primary concerns for replication are the small effect size (pr = .21) and the modest sample size (N = 119) for a correlational design. This combination results in an imprecise estimate of the effect that is not robust to sampling variation in a new study. Although the original result was statistically significant, the low statistical power to detect such a small effect makes a successful replication improbable.
---
0.42
The primary concern is the combination of a small effect size (pr = .21) and a relatively small sample size (N = 119), which indicates the study had low statistical power. This pairing increases the likelihood that the original result was an overestimation of the true effect, thus decreasing the probability of a successful replication. While the reported p-value is significant and the author is highly cited, these factors are generally less predictive than the study's statistical power.
---
0.42
This prediction is low primarily due to the combination of a small sample size (N=119) and a small effect size (pr = .21), which results in low statistical power and increases the likelihood that the original finding is a false positive or an overestimated effect. While the inferred p-value (p ≈ .01) is not borderline, the study's subfield of social psychology has a documented history of lower replication rates, especially for studies with these characteristics. A direct replication is therefore more likely than not to fail to find a significant result.
---
0.35
The likelihood of successful replication is low due to the combination of a small sample size (N=119) and a small effect size (pr=.21). Furthermore, the reported p-value is close to the conventional .05 threshold of significance (`prep`=.92 corresponds to p≈.04), and such marginal findings are less likely to replicate. While the correlational design is simple, this weak statistical evidence suggests the original result may be an overestimation of the true effect."

This study is highly likely to replicate because the reported null finding is supported by a very large sample (N=564). The minuscule effect size (d = -0.004) is precisely estimated due to the large sample, meaning a replication is very likely to also find a negligible effect and thus confirm the original conclusion of resisted generalization. The simple analysis (t-test) also contributes to a higher probability of successful replication.
---
0.08
The probability of a successful replication is very low. The original study’s key test statistic (t = -0.11) is far from statistically significant, as reflected in the very low reported `prep` value and a negligible effect size (d = -0.004). Because the original large sample (N=564) provided strong evidence for a null effect, a direct replication is highly likely to yield a similar non-significant outcome.
---
0.05
The original study reported a statistically non-significant result with a minuscule effect size (d = -0.004) and a t-statistic very close to zero. Although the sample size was very large (N=564), this high statistical power makes the null finding more, not less, convincing. Therefore, an independent replication is extremely unlikely to achieve a statistically significant result, as the true effect is likely zero or trivially small.
---
0.05
The reported statistical evidence for this specific finding is exceedingly weak. The effect size (d = -0.004) is negligible, and the test statistic (t = -0.11) corresponds to a highly non-significant p-value (p ≈ .82). Although the sample size is large, this only strengthens the conclusion that the true effect is likely zero, making it extremely improbable that a replication would find a statistically significant result (p < .05).
---
0.15
The reported effect size (d = -0.004) and test statistic (t = -0.11) are both extremely close to zero, indicating a clear null result with a very high p-value. While the large sample size provides a precise estimate, it only strengthens the conclusion that the true effect is negligible, making it highly improbable that a replication would find a statistically significant effect. The authors’ own reported `prep` value of .18, a now-outdated metric for the probability of replication, is also very low and consistent with this prediction.
---
0.10
The reported effect size (d = -0.004) is infinitesimally small, and the test statistic (t = -0.11) corresponds to a clear null finding (p ≈ .91). While the very large sample size (N=564) provides a precise estimate, in this case it powerfully suggests that the true effect is indeed zero. Therefore, a replication is extremely unlikely to find a statistically significant effect, which is the typical definition of replication success."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
Does moral behavior draw on a belief in free will? Two experiments examined whether inducing participants to believe that human behavior is predetermined would encourage cheating. In Experiment 1, participants read either text that encouraged a belief in determinism (i.e., that portrayed behavior as the consequence of environmental and genetic factors) or neutral text. Exposure to the deterministic message increased cheating on a task in which participants could passively allow a flawed computer program to reveal answers to mathematical problems that they had been instructed to solve themselves. Moreover, increased cheating behavior was mediated by decreased belief in free will. In Experiment 2, participants who read deterministic statements cheated by overpaying themselves for performance on a cognitive task; participants who read statements endorsing free will did not. These findings suggest that the debate over free will has societal, as well as scientific and theoretical, implications.

The primary reason for this low prediction is the extremely small sample size, which makes the results highly unstable and the large effect size likely to be inflated. This issue is compounded by the study's design as a conceptual priming experiment, a type of study within social psychology that has historically proven difficult to replicate. While the reported p-value is strong, its evidential value is severely undermined by the small sample.
---
0.25
The prediction is low due to the extremely small sample size (N=30), which makes the study statistically underpowered and the reported large effect size (d=0.88) likely to be inflated. Conceptual priming manipulations, common in social psychology, have a history of poor replicability. The combination of these factors suggests the original finding is not robust, despite the significant p-value.
---
0.25
The extremely small sample size (N=30) is a major red flag, as results from such studies are often statistically unstable and prone to overestimating the true effect size. While the reported p-value and effect size are strong, such large effects (d = .88) from subtle behavioral priming manipulations in social psychology have frequently failed to replicate in larger, more definitive studies. The simple t‑test analysis is a positive, but it does not outweigh the fundamental concerns about statistical power and the potential for a false positive result.
---
0.25
The prediction is low primarily due to the very small sample size (N=30), which provides low statistical power and increases the likelihood that the reported large effect size (d=0.88) is an overestimate. While the p-value is below .01 and the first author is highly cited, studies in social psychology using subtle behavioral manipulations of this type have historically shown low replication rates. A better-powered replication is unlikely to find an effect of this magnitude.
---
0.25
The study's very small sample size (N=30) is a major weakness, as it provides low statistical power and makes the large reported effect size (d=0.88) likely to be inflated. Furthermore, this study uses a social priming manipulation to influence a complex behavior, a paradigm from a subfield that has historically shown low rates of successful replication. These factors combine to suggest a low probability that a well-powered independent replication would reproduce the significant result.
---
0.25
The probability of successful replication is low due to the extremely small sample size, which provides very low statistical power and suggests the large reported effect size is likely an overestimation. Social psychology studies involving subtle behavioral priming have a poor replication record, and the finding is conceptually vulnerable to contextual factors not controlled in the original design. Although the p-value is strong, it is undermined by the small sample, a combination that often fails to replicate in higher-powered studies."

The primary reason for the low replication estimate is the extremely small sample size of four participants. While the reported p-value is low and the effect size is very large, such results from tiny samples are highly volatile and the effect size is likely a severe overestimation. Furthermore, the study's central conclusion appears to be based on the absence of an effect (a null interaction), a claim which is not statistically sound given the extremely low power of the design.
---
0.35
The reported p-value is very low and the effect size is extremely large, which on the surface would suggest a robust finding. However, the sample size of only four participants is a critical methodological weakness. Results from such a small sample are highly unreliable, may not generalize to a new set of participants, and are likely to be substantial overestimates of the true effect, making a successful replication improbable.
---
0.20
The primary concern is the extremely small sample size of four participants, which makes the results highly susceptible to sampling error and unlikely to generalize to a new sample. Although the reported p-value is low and the effect size is very large, these statistics are likely to be highly inflated due to the small sample size. An independent replication would almost certainly observe a much smaller effect, substantially lowering the probability of a successful outcome.
---
0.35
The primary reason for this low prediction is the critically small sample size (N=4), which makes the result highly unreliable and susceptible to idiosyncratic data from just one or two participants. While the reported effect size is massive and the p-value is low, these metrics are likely severe overestimations due to the small sample. A new study would probably find a much smaller effect that may not reach statistical significance.
---
0.75
While the sample size is extremely small (N=4), several other factors suggest a high likelihood of replication. The study reports a very strong p‑value (p=0.005) and a massive effect size (η²=.74), indicating a powerful and easily detectable phenomenon. Furthermore, the within‑subjects psychophysics design is common in cognitive psychology and is less prone to the variability that plagues studies in other subfields, making a successful replication probable.
---
0.65
While the sample size of four is exceptionally small and a major risk factor, this type of auditory perception study often uses designs with many trials per subject, which can yield robust results if variability between subjects is low. The combination of a massive effect size (η²=.74) and a highly significant p-value (p=0.005) suggests a powerful underlying phenomenon. Therefore, despite the small sample, the strength of the statistical evidence in this specific context points towards a successful replication."

Current conceptualizations of psychological distance (e.g., construal-level theory) refer to the degree of overlap between the self and some other person, place, or point in time. We propose a complementary view in which perceptual and motor representations of physical distance influence people's thoughts and feelings without reference to the self, extending research and theory on the effects of distance into domains where construal-level theory is silent. Across four experiments, participants were primed with either spatial closeness or spatial distance by plotting an assigned set of points on a Cartesian coordinate plane. Compared with the closeness prime, the distance prime produced greater enjoyment of media depicting embarrassment (Study 1), less emotional distress from violent media (Study 2), lower estimates of the number of calories in unhealthy food (Study 3), and weaker reports of emotional attachments to family members and hometowns (Study 4). These results support a broader conceptualization of distance-mediated effects on judgment and affect.

This study has a low probability of successful replication due to a combination of risk factors. The sample size is small, which makes the study underpowered and can lead to inflated effect size estimates like the large one reported here (ηp² = .11). Furthermore, the study's topic, a subtle social-cognitive priming effect, belongs to a subfield of psychology that has faced significant challenges during the replication crisis.
---
0.25
This study has several indicators of low replicability, despite a statistically significant result. The sample size is small for a three-group design (n=28/cell), which can produce inflated and unstable effect estimates. Furthermore, the large effect size (ηp² =.11) is surprisingly strong for a subtle behavioral priming manipulation, a type of finding from social cognition that has historically replicated poorly. The use of the outdated `prep` statistic also places the paper in an era (mid-2000s) whose common research practices have since been associated with low replication rates.
---
0.22
This prediction is low due to the small sample size (N=84), which risks yielding an unstable and inflated effect size estimate. The study investigates a subtle social-cognitive priming effect, a research area that has historically demonstrated poor replicability, making the large reported effect size (ηp² = .11) for an indirect manipulation highly suspect. These factors combine to suggest a low probability of a new study finding a similar statistically significant result.
---
0.25
The study's focus on subtle psychological priming, a paradigm with a history of low replicability, is a primary concern. The small sample size (N=84) means the study was likely underpowered, which makes the surprisingly large reported effect size (ηp² = .11) a probable overestimation. Although the p-value is strong (p ≈ .01, inferred from the F-statistic), the combination of a small sample and a large effect for a subtle manipulation from this research area suggests a low probability of successful replication.
---
0.25
The study’s low sample size (N=84) provides insufficient statistical power, which increases the likelihood of a false positive and inflates the reported effect size. The subfield (social psychology) and specific topic (priming) have a well-documented history of low replicability, and the subtle manipulation may not be robust. While the reported p-value is strong, these other factors suggest a low probability of successful independent replication.
---
0.22
The probability is low primarily due to the small sample size (N=84), which provides low statistical power for a three-group design and increases the chance of a false positive. Furthermore, the topic of abstract-judgment priming has a poor replication track record in social and cognitive psychology. The large reported effect size, when found with a small sample, is likely to be an overestimation and therefore less believable."

The extremely large F-statistic (F=192.89) and very low p-value (<.001) are the strongest indicators, suggesting a massive and statistically robust effect that is not a chance finding. While the sample size of 82 is moderate, the use of a repeated-measures design provides good statistical power for detecting such a large effect. The combination of an experienced author and a powerful experimental effect makes a successful replication highly probable.

0.94
The prediction is very high due to the extremely large F-statistic and correspondingly low p-value (<.001), which indicate a massive effect that is highly unlikely to be a statistical artifact. This large effect size is the single best predictor of replicability and suggests the finding should be robust, especially given the adequate sample size for a controlled, repeated-measures lab experiment. The established author and standard analysis type further increase confidence in the result.

The probability of replication is very high due to the extremely large F-statistic and very low p-value (<.001), which together imply a massive and highly robust effect size. The within-subjects design (RM ANOVA) with a moderate sample size (N=82) would have exceptionally high power to detect such a strong effect. While the analysis is moderately complex, the sheer magnitude of the primary statistical evidence suggests the finding is not a fluke.

0.95
This study has an exceptionally high probability of successful replication, driven primarily by the massive F-statistic (F=192.89) and very low p-value (<.001). These metrics imply an extremely large and robust effect size, which is the strongest predictor of replicability. The respectable sample size for a within-subjects design and the first author's high citation count further bolster confidence in the finding.
---
0.78
The reported p‑value is very low (<.001), and the corresponding F‑statistic is exceptionally large, which are strong predictors of a successful replication. However, such a massive effect in social psychology can sometimes indicate strong demand characteristics or other methodological artifacts that may be difficult to reproduce perfectly. While the moderate sample size and subfield are minor weaknesses, the sheer statistical strength of the original finding makes a significant replication likely, even if the effect size is smaller.
---
0.88
The primary driver for this high probability is the extremely low p-value (p < .001) associated with a massive F-statistic, implying a very large effect size. Such strong statistical evidence is the single best predictor of replication success and suggests a highly robust finding. Although the sample size is modest and social psychology studies can have lower replication rates, the sheer magnitude of the reported effect makes it very likely to be detected again in a replication attempt."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
People are motivated to maintain social connection with others, and those who lack social connection with other humans may try to compensate by creating a sense of human connection with nonhuman agents. This may occur in at least two ways-by anthropomorphizing nonhuman agents such as nonhuman animals and gadgets to make them appear more humanlike and by increasing belief in commonly anthropomorphized religious agents (such as God). Three studies support these hypotheses both among individuals who are chronically lonely (Study 1) and among those who are induced to feel lonely (Studies 2 and 3). Additional findings suggest that such results are not simply produced by any negative affective state (Study 3). These results have important implications not only for understanding when people are likely to treat nonhuman agents as humanlike (anthropomorphism), but also for understanding when people treat human agents as nonhuman (dehumanization).

This study's predicted replicability is low due to several statistical weaknesses. The sample size (N=57) is very small, which often leads to unstable and overestimated effects, despite the reported large effect size (η²=.12). Furthermore, the p-value of 0.01 is not highly compelling and falls in a range that has been associated with lower replication rates. The combination of a small sample with a moderately significant p-value, a common feature in social psychology studies from that era, suggests the original result may not be robust.
---
0.35
The primary concerns are the small sample size (N=57) for a complex mixed ANOVA design and a p‑value (p=.01) that is not highly compelling. While the reported effect size (η² = .12) is large, such estimates from small studies are often inflated. These factors, combined with the study's origin in social psychology—a subfield with known replication challenges for subtle effects—suggest a below‑average probability of successful replication.
---
0.35
The prediction is low due to the combination of a very small sample size (N=57) and a complex analysis (mixed ANOVA), which substantially increases the risk of a spurious result. Although the reported effect size is large, it is likely inflated by the low sample size, and the p-value of .01 is not compelling enough to overcome these methodological concerns about statistical power and analytic flexibility.
---
0.35
The primary concern is the small sample size (N=57), which provides low statistical power and suggests the large reported effect size (η² = .12) is likely an overestimation. The p-value of .01, while statistically significant, is not exceptionally low, further reducing confidence. These factors, combined with a complex analysis (mixed ANOVA) in a subfield known for replication challenges, outweigh the positive indicator of the author's high citation count.
---
0.35
The primary predictor of low replicability here is the very small sample size (N=57) for a mixed ANOVA, which provides low statistical power and suggests the reported medium-to-large effect size may be inflated. While the p-value is significant (p=0.01), it is not overwhelmingly so, and studies in social psychology involving subtle manipulations of internal states have historically shown lower replication rates. These risk factors suggest a below-average probability of successful replication.
---
0.35
The primary predictor of low replicability here is the small sample size (N=57), which provides low statistical power and increases the likelihood of a chance finding. While the effect size is large and the p-value is below the .05 threshold, such results are often inflated and less reliable in underpowered studies. The study's subfield, social psychology, has also demonstrated a lower average replication rate in large-scale replication projects."

The prediction is very high due to an extremely large effect size (ηp² = .59) and a correspondingly high F-statistic (F=109.74) and low p-value.

The prediction for high replicability is driven by the exceptionally large reported effect size (ηp² = .59) and the correspondingly extreme F-statistic and p-value. This powerful statistical evidence, combined with a large sample size for a laboratory experiment (N=240), suggests a very robust effect that should be readily observable in a direct replication. The study's focus on a straightforward behavioral choice in an economic game further increases confidence over more subjective psychological phenomena.

This study has an extremely high probability of successful replication due to a confluence of positive factors. The very large effect size (ηp² = .59) and massive test statistic (F(1, 76) = 109.74) indicate a powerful, non-fluke result, which is further supported by the large sample size (N=240). The use of a simple, standard statistical analysis (ANOVA/t-test) in a controlled experimental setting minimizes ambiguity and makes the finding highly robust.

This study has a very high probability of successful replication due to its exceptionally strong statistical evidence, including a very large sample size, a massive effect size (ηp² = .59), and a correspondingly low p-value. While social psychology studies have historically shown lower replication rates, the robust and straightforward nature of this experimental finding—a clear behavioral choice in a game—makes it very likely to be reproducible. The simple t-test analysis also reduces the risk of errors that can arise from more complex statistical models.

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
Word-order rules impose major constraints on linguistic behavior. For example, adjectives appear before nouns in English, and after nouns in French. This means that constraints on word order must be language-specific properties upheld on-line by the language system. Despite the importance of these rules, little is known about how they operate. We report an influence of word order on the activation of phonological representations. Participants were presented with colored objects and asked to name either the colors or the objects; the phonological similarity between the object and color names was manipulated. French speakers showed a phonological congruency effect in color naming, but not in object naming. English participants yielded the opposite pattern: a phonological effect in object naming, but not in color naming. Differences in the typical order of nouns and adjectives in French and English provide a plausible account for this cross-linguistic contrast. More generally, these results provide direct evidence for the operation of word-order constraints during language production.

The reported p-value and extremely large effect size (d = 1.71) seem strong, but they are derived from a very small sample (N=15). Such small samples produce highly unstable estimates, and the massive effect size is a strong indicator of ""winner's curse"" inflation, where random chance in a small group produces an exaggerated result. A well-powered replication is unlikely to observe such a large effect, making the original finding difficult to reproduce.
---
0.35
The primary concern for replication is the extremely small sample size (N=15), which provides low statistical power and can lead to spurious results. While the p-value is low and the effect size is very large (d=1.71), such a massive effect is highly suspect and likely inflated in a small-N study. The original result may have capitalized on chance, making a successful replication with a new, larger sample less probable.
---
0.25
The extremely small sample size (N=15) is a major weakness, making the study highly underpowered and susceptible to false positives. The resulting effect size (d=1.71) is implausibly large for this type of research and is likely a significant overestimation due to sampling error. While the reported p-value is low, the weak evidence base makes it unlikely that a well-powered, independent replication would find a statistically significant result.
---
0.35
The very small sample size (N=15) is a major weakness that makes the study severely underpowered and suggests the massive reported effect size (d=1.71) is highly inflated. Although the p-value is low, it is not sufficient to overcome the high probability that a better-powered replication would find a much smaller, and potentially non-significant, effect. Therefore, the likelihood of a successful replication is low.
---
0.25
The primary reason for this low prediction is the extremely small sample size (N=15), which makes the finding highly susceptible to sampling error. While the p-value is low and the effect size is very large (d=1.71), such large effects found in underpowered studies are often significantly inflated. A direct replication with a more appropriately sized sample would likely find a much smaller effect, if any at all.
---
0.65
The primary concern is the extremely small sample size (N=15), which suggests the massive reported effect size (d=1.71) is likely inflated. However, this risk is counteracted by the very low p-value (<.007), which indicates a strong signal that is less likely to be a mere statistical artifact. The study's simple analysis (t-test) and focus on a core cognitive-linguistic process, a domain with more robust findings, also bolster confidence in a successful replication."

The likelihood of replication is low despite the adequate sample size and significant p-value. This is primarily because the key finding involves a complex interaction based on menstrual cycle effects on mate preference, a specific research area in evolutionary psychology with a poor track record of successful replications. The small-to-medium effect size (f = 0.19) further suggests that the original finding may not be robust.
---
0.18
This prediction is low primarily because research on how the ovulatory cycle affects mating preferences has a very poor track record of successful replication. The finding relies on a complex interaction effect which is statistically less robust and harder to replicate than a simple main effect. While the p-value is relatively low and the sample size is adequate, these positive signals are heavily outweighed by the general unreliability of findings in this specific subfield of evolutionary psychology.
---
0.18
The likelihood of replication is low because the study's topic, ovulatory shifts in mate preference, belongs to a subfield with a well-documented history of failed replications. The study also reports a small effect size (f = 0.19) for a complex interaction, which is inherently less robust and requires a larger sample to be detected reliably. While the p-value is below .01, it is not strong enough to overcome the considerable skepticism warranted by the topic and design.
---
0.15
The study's hypothesis, centered on an ""ovulatory shift"" in mate preference, belongs to a subfield with a well-documented history of failed replications. Although the sample size is moderate and the p-value is significant (p = .008), the effect size is small (f = 0.19), making the result difficult to reproduce reliably. The complexity of the specific interaction effect further lowers the probability of a successful replication, as such findings are often less robust than simpler main effects.
---
0.25
This study's low replication likelihood is primarily driven by its subject matter and the complexity of the finding. Research linking attraction to menstrual cycle phases has a notably poor track record of replication, and the reported effect is a complex interaction, which is inherently harder to reproduce than a simple main effect. While the sample size is adequate and the p-value is below the conventional threshold, the small-to-medium effect size (f = 0.19) and the study's placement within social psychology—a subfield with known replication challenges—suggest a high chance of failure in a direct replication attempt.
---
0.25
The study investigates a complex interaction effect related to ovulatory cycle shifts on mate preference, a subfield with a well-documented history of replication failures. Although the original study reported a significant p-value (p = .008) with a moderate sample size, the smallish effect size (f = 0.19) is vulnerable to publication bias and may not be robust. The combination of a theoretically complex and historically fragile effect makes a successful independent replication unlikely, despite the apparently solid primary statistics."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
Because men of higher genetic quality tend to be poorer partners and parents than men of lower genetic quality, women may profit from securing a stable investment from the latter, while obtaining good genes via extrapair mating with the former. Only if conception occurs, however, do the evolutionary benefits of such a strategy overcome its costs. Accordingly, we predicted that (a) partnered women should prefer attached men, because such men are more likely than single men to have pair-bonding qualities, and hence to be good replacement partners, and (b) this inclination should reverse when fertility rises, because attached men are less available for impromptu sex than single men. In this study, 208 women rated the attractiveness of men described as single or attached.

The predicted replication success is very low due to the subject matter; evolutionary psychology studies on ovulatory shifts have a well-documented history of failing to replicate in large, pre-registered trials. The study also reports a small-to-medium effect size for a complex interaction, which is inherently more difficult to reproduce than a simple main effect. These factors substantially lower the confidence in the finding, despite the moderately large sample size and statistically significant p-value.
---
0.22
Despite a statistically significant p-value, this finding comes from the ""ovulatory shift"" literature in evolutionary psychology, a subfield with a well-documented history of replication failures. The small-to-medium effect size (f = 0.19) and the complexity of the predicted interaction further suggest the result is not robust and would be difficult to reproduce. An independent replication would likely be underpowered to detect such a subtle effect, if it exists at all.
---
0.15
The prediction is very low because the study investigates an ovulatory-shift hypothesis, a research area in evolutionary psychology with a well-documented history of failed replications. The reported effect size is small (f = 0.19), making the finding difficult to detect reliably and suggesting the original result may be fragile. These factors outweigh the moderately large sample and significant p-value.
---
0.35
The study reports a p-value that is significant but not overwhelmingly strong (p=0.008) for a small-to-medium effect size. Crucially, the finding is a complex three-way interaction (participant's relationship status × fertility phase × target's relationship status), which is often less robust than a simple main effect. Furthermore, research on ovulatory cycle shifts in mate preference is a subfield known for prominent replication failures, suggesting that findings in this area are often fragile and difficult to reproduce.
---
0.25
The prediction is low due to several factors. The study tests a complex interaction effect in evolutionary psychology, a subfield where similar findings regarding menstrual cycle effects have a poor replication record. Furthermore, the small-to-medium effect size (f=0.19) and a p-value that is not overwhelmingly low (p=0.008) suggest the finding may not be robust enough for successful replication.
---
0.25
The low probability is primarily driven by the study's topic, as ""ovulatory shift"" hypotheses in evolutionary psychology have a well-documented record of failed replications. Although the sample size is moderate, the reported effect size is small-to-medium (f=0.19), which is often inflated in original reports and difficult to detect again without a much larger sample. The complex interaction effect is also statistically less robust and harder to replicate than a simpler main effect, further reducing confidence."

The prediction is low primarily due to the extremely small sample size (N=14), which provides a very unstable foundation for the findings. While the reported effect size is massive (__p^2 = .522) and the implied p-value is highly significant, this combination with a tiny sample is a classic indicator of an overestimated effect. An independent replication is therefore unlikely to reproduce a result of this magnitude and would have a high probability of failing to reach statistical significance.
---
0.35
This prediction is low primarily due to the extremely small sample size (N=14), which results in very low statistical power and makes the findings highly susceptible to sampling error. While the reported p-value is low and the effect size is massive (__p^2 = .522), such large effects found in small-sample studies are often severely overestimated and fail to replicate. A well-powered independent replication would likely find a much smaller effect, if any, and thus has a low probability of achieving statistical significance.
---
0.68
The study reports a very large effect size (__p^2 = 0.522) and a highly significant p-value (p ≈ .002 based on the F-statistic), which are strong positive predictors of replicability. However, this evidence is derived from an extremely small sample (N=14), which makes the effect estimate likely to be inflated and increases the risk of a chance finding. The strength of the statistical evidence suggests the effect is probably real, but the tiny sample introduces substantial uncertainty.
---
0.62
While the extremely small sample size (N=14) is a major concern that suggests the very large effect size is likely inflated, the finding is supported by a highly significant p-value (p≈.002, calculated from the F-statistic). This strong statistical evidence is a key predictor of replicability and, despite the low power of the original study, suggests a better-than-even chance that a well-powered replication would find a significant effect. The within-subjects design also adds power, slightly increasing confidence in the result.
---
0.35
The primary concern is the extremely small sample size (N=14), which provides low statistical power and leads to unstable, likely inflated estimates. Although the reported effect size is huge (__p^2 = 0.522) with a corresponding highly significant p-value, such impressive results from tiny samples are classic indicators of a ""winner's curse"" that often fail to replicate. These factors combined suggest the original result is unreliable despite its apparent statistical strength.
---
0.45
The primary concern is the extremely small sample size (N=14), which makes the results highly susceptible to sampling error and instability. Although the reported effect size is exceptionally large (ηp^2 = 0.522) with a correspondingly low p-value, such massive effects found in underpowered studies are often severely overestimated. This high risk of inflation tempers confidence in the finding's robustness, leading to a moderate-to-low prediction of replication success."

Theories of moral judgment have long emphasized reasoning and conscious thought while downplaying the role of intuitive and contextual influences. However, recent research has demonstrated that incidental feelings of disgust can influence moral judgments and make them more severe. This study involved two experiments demonstrating that the reverse effect can occur when the notion of physical purity is made salient, thus making moral judgments less severe. After having the cognitive concept of cleanliness activated (Experiment 1) or after physically cleansing themselves after experiencing disgust (Experiment 2), participants found certain moral actions to be less wrong than did participants who had not been exposed to a cleanliness manipulation. The findings support the idea that moral judgment can be driven by intuitive processes, rather than deliberate reasoning. One of those intuitions appears to be physical purity, because it has a strong connection to moral purity.

Compared to other psychology studies, consider how the combination of sample size, p-value, effect size, statistical method complexity, first author citation count, and subfield influences replication likelihood. Provide a probability between 0 and 1 on the first line, then give a concise 2–3 sentence rationale that reflects this comparative judgment.",0.15,0.15,0.25,0.2,0.15,0.15,0.175,"0.15
The very small sample size (N=43) yields low statistical power, making the large reported effect size (ηp² = .16) likely to be an unstable overestimation. Furthermore, social priming and embodied cognition studies from this era have a notoriously low replication rate. While the original result was significant, the combination of these risk factors makes a successful replication highly improbable.
---
0.15
The very small sample size is a major weakness, making the study highly underpowered and the results susceptible to sampling error. The resulting large effect size is likely a significant overestimation, which is common in small studies that happen to yield a significant p-value. Moreover, this type of social priming research has a well-documented history of failing to replicate in subsequent, higher-powered studies.
---
0.25
This study has a very high risk of replication failure. The sample size is extremely small for a between-subjects design, leading to low statistical power and a high chance that the result is a false positive or that the effect size is dramatically inflated. The reported effect size is implausibly large for a subtle priming manipulation, and the subfield of social priming is known for having many foundational findings that have failed to replicate.
---
0.20
The very small sample size (N=43) provides low statistical power, increasing the chance that the strong reported p-value and large effect size are inflated or the result of a Type I error. Furthermore, the study falls within the subfield of social priming, an area of psychology that has faced significant and well-documented replication challenges. These factors combined suggest a low probability of a successful independent replication, despite the seemingly strong initial evidence.
---
0.15
This prediction is low due to several major risk factors for replication failure. The sample size (N=43) is extremely small for a between-subjects design, which produces unstable estimates and makes it likely that the large reported effect size is inflated. Moreover, the study type—social priming—is from a subfield that has a well-documented history of low replicability for subtle experimental manipulations. These factors strongly suggest the original finding was a false positive or a substantial overestimation of a true effect.
---
0.15
This study has a very low probability of replication due to its extremely small sample size, which provides insufficient statistical power and makes the reported large effect size likely to be an overestimate. Furthermore, findings in this subfield of social psychology concerning embodied cognition and priming have a well-documented history of failing to replicate. The original study's low p-value is not persuasive when weighed against these significant structural weaknesses."

While the sample size is extremely small, the reported effect size is massive (d=1.573) and the p‑value is highly significant (p<.001), suggesting a powerful and easily detectable phenomenon. Basic cognitive perception studies often uncover robust effects that are consistent across individuals, which would explain obtaining such strong results with a small sample. The combination of a very large effect and a simple analysis makes a successful replication highly probable.
---
0.85
The extremely small sample size (N=8) is a major concern, as it can produce unstable and inflated results. However, this is counteracted by a massive effect size (d=1.573) and a highly significant p-value, which are harder to achieve by chance with a small N. Given that the study is in basic perception—a field where effects are often large and consistent across individuals—it is plausible that this is a robust phenomenon that will replicate successfully.
---
0.75
This study has a very strong chance of replication despite its extremely small sample size. The reported p-value is very low (<.001) and the effect size is massive (d=1.57), suggesting a powerful and easily detectable perceptual effect, which is common in cognitive psychology. While the small sample introduces high uncertainty and potential for effect size inflation, the sheer strength of the reported signal makes a successful replication likely.
---
0.88
The extremely small sample size (N=8) is a significant concern, suggesting the reported effect size may be inflated. However, this is counteracted by the exceptionally strong evidence (p < .001, d = 1.573), which would be difficult to obtain with a small sample unless the underlying effect is genuinely large and consistent. Studies on basic perceptual phenomena, particularly with simple analyses, also tend to replicate well, making a successful replication highly probable.
---
0.82
Despite the very small sample size, the reported effect is exceptionally strong (p<.001, d=1.573), suggesting a high likelihood of replication. The study concerns a basic perceptual phenomenon, which often yields robust effects that can be reliably detected even with few participants. The simple t-test analysis also reduces the risk of inflated results due to analytical flexibility.
---
0.88
Although the sample size is extremely small, the reported effect size is massive (d > 1.5), resulting in a highly significant p-value. Such powerful and stable effects are characteristic of findings in low-level visual perception, which tend to be more robust and replicable than those in other subfields. The simple analysis and highly-cited author add to the confidence that a replication would find a significant effect in the same direction."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
Much research contrasts self-reported personality traits across cultures. We submit that this enterprise is weakened by significant methodological problems (in particular, the reference-group effect) that undermine the validity of national averages of personality scores. In this study, behavioral and demographic predictors of conscientiousness were correlated with different cross-national measures of conscientiousness based on self-reports, peer reports, and perceptions of national character. The predictors correlated strongly with perceptions of national character, but not with self-reports and peer reports. Country-level self- and peer-report measures of conscientiousness failed as markers of between-nation differences in personality.

The prediction is high due to a large sample size for a cross-national study (N=70 countries), which provides strong statistical power. This power, paired with a moderate effect size (r=-0.43) and an inferred low p-value, suggests the finding is statistically robust and not a product of chance. The straightforward correlational analysis and the author's high citation count further bolster confidence in the replicability of this methodological finding.

This study combines a moderate effect size (r = -0.43) with a large sample size for a cross-national analysis (N=70), yielding a very robust, low p-value. The straightforward correlational design is less susceptible to replication failure than complex analyses. The finding is also theoretically plausible and advanced by a highly-cited author, which strengthens confidence in the result.

This study has a high probability of replication due to several strong factors. The sample size of 70 countries is large for a cross-national analysis, and the reported effect size (r = -0.43) is moderate and supported by a very low p-value (p < .001). The statistical method is a simple correlation, which reduces analytic flexibility and increases reproducibility, and the high citation count of the first author suggests a well-established and experienced research team.

The probability of replication is low due to the combination of a small sample size and a modest effect size. An N of 53 provides low statistical power to reliably detect an effect of r = -.31, and the resulting effect size estimate is likely to be imprecise. The inexactly reported p-value (<.05) further reduces confidence, as it often indicates a result that is only barely statistically significant.
---
0.35
This study has a high risk of replication failure due to the combination of a small sample size (N=53) and a p-value reported as just meeting the significance threshold (p<.05). Such a finding is statistically fragile, and the modest effect size (r=-.31) could be an overestimation due to sampling error. Studies in this subfield of social cognition, particularly on conceptual metaphor, often investigate subtle effects that can be difficult to robustly reproduce.
---
0.35
The prediction is low primarily due to the combination of a small sample size (N=53) and a p-value reported as just under the .05 threshold. This pattern suggests the study was underpowered, making the observed small-to-medium effect size (r = -.31) likely an overestimation of the true effect due to the ""winner's curse."" The complexity of linking a personality trait to a subtle cognitive bias in a subfield with mixed replication history further decreases the predicted chance of success.
---
0.40
The primary concern is the small sample size (N=53) for a correlational study, which provides low statistical power for the reported modest effect size (r=-.31). This increases the chance that the original result is a type I error or that the effect size is overestimated, making a successful replication less likely. The low author citation count and the vagueness of the reported p-value (""<.05"") are also minor, negative indicators.
---
0.35
The reported p-value of <.05 combined with a small sample size (N=53) is a major risk factor for replication failure, as it suggests the study was underpowered and the result may be a false positive or an inflated effect size. The effect itself (r=-.31) is modest, meaning a well-powered replication might find a smaller, non-significant result. Furthermore, conceptual metaphor studies within social and cognitive psychology have historically had mixed replication success.
---
0.35
The low probability reflects several risk factors for replication failure. The sample size (N=53) is small for a correlational study, and the reported p-value (p<.05) for a modest effect size (r=-.31) suggests the original finding may not be robust. Furthermore, surprising findings from this subfield of social cognition, particularly those involving conceptual metaphor, have historically demonstrated low replication rates."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
Action control in a changing environment requires that one shield current goals from distracting information (goal shielding) and at the same time monitor the environment for potentially significant stimuli that may afford a goal switch (background monitoring). Response conflicts modulate the balance between goal shielding and background monitoring, as indicated by reduced susceptibility to interference after response conflicts. Such conflict-adaptation effects have been attributed to enhanced recruitment of cognitive control on trials following conflicts. Here we show that conflict triggers increased goal shielding on the conflict trial itself. Subjects performed a spatial compatibility task during which they had to notice rare prospective memory cues. Such cues were overlooked more often on conflict trials than on nonconflict trials, a result indicating that shielding of the current goal and inhibition of distractors were increased on the current trial when it involved a response conflict. Thus, evidence for enhanced recruitment of control following conflict may partly reflect aftereffects of goal shielding on the conflict trial itself.

The prediction is high due to the large reported effect size (ηp² = .14) and a p‑value (p ≈ .017, inferred from the F‑statistic) that is substantially lower than the .05 threshold. The respectable sample size (N=40) for a within‑subjects cognitive experiment provides confidence in the stability of this large effect. Although the use of an outdated `prep` value is unusual, the primary statistical evidence strongly suggests the finding is robust and likely to replicate.
---
0.85
The study has several markers of high replicability, most notably a large effect size (ηp² = .14) and a sample size (N=40) that is adequate for a powerful within‑subjects experimental design. The first author is well-established, and the analysis is straightforward for a standard cognitive paradigm. While the p-value (p ≈ .017, derived from the F‑statistic) is not overwhelmingly low, the large magnitude of the effect is the strongest indicator that the finding is robust and likely to replicate.
---
0.78
The prediction is high primarily due to the large reported effect size (ηp² = .14) and a p‑value (calculated as p ≈ .017 from the F‑statistic) that indicates a robust finding. Although the sample size of 40 is modest, it is adequate for the within-subjects design used in a typical cognitive paradigm, which, combined with a simple ANOVA, suggests the result is likely replicable. The established author and straightforward experimental design further increase confidence.
---
0.82
This prediction is high due to a combination of strong statistical evidence and a robust study design. The reported effect size is large (__p^2 = .14) and the p-value is solid (calculated as p ≈ .017 from the F-statistic), which means the study was very well-powered despite a modest sample size. The use of a standard, controlled laboratory paradigm in cognitive psychology with an experienced author further increases the likelihood of a successful replication.
---
0.82
The prediction of a high likelihood of replication success is primarily driven by the large and internally consistent effect size (__p^2 = .14). While the sample size (N=40) is modest, it provides high statistical power for a within‑subjects design with an effect of this magnitude. The finding is further supported by a p‑value (calculated from the F‑statistic to be ~.017) that is clearly significant, suggesting a robust experimental result.

0.82
The reported effect size is large (ηp² = .14) and the p-value is solid (p≈.017, inferred from the reported prep), which are strong indicators of a replicable finding. Although the sample size (N=40) is only moderate, the study involves a standard cognitive psychology paradigm with a straightforward ANOVA, increasing confidence in the result. The combination of a large effect from a simple, well-understood experimental design suggests a high likelihood of replication."

The reported effect size is very large (ηp² = .23) and the p-value is strong (p < .01), which are both positive indicators for replication. Furthermore, the study uses a classic laboratory-based cognitive paradigm (visual search), a type of experiment that tends to be more robust and replicable than other designs. The primary weakness is the small sample size, but the strength of the effect and the straightforward design suggest a high likelihood of successful replication.
---
0.92
The study reports a very large effect size (ηp² = .23) and a correspondingly low p-value, indicating a strong and clear signal. This finding is based on a standard visual search paradigm testing a well-established evolutionary hypothesis, a type of basic cognitive research that tends to replicate robustly. While the sample size is modest, the powerful effect size makes a successful replication highly likely.
---
0.88
The study reports a large effect size (ηp^2 = .23) and a highly significant p-value (<.01) from a simple ANOVA, which are strong indicators of replicability. Confidence is further increased because the abstract reports that the finding was consistent across three separate experiments using a standard visual search paradigm. While the sample size is modest, the statistical evidence is powerful enough to suggest a successful replication is very likely.
---
0.85
This study is highly likely to replicate due to its very strong statistical evidence. The reported p-value is low (p<.01) and the effect size is large (ηp² = .23), indicating a robust finding. Although the sample size is relatively small, the sheer magnitude of the effect makes it probable that an independent replication would successfully detect it.

0.75
This study has a high likelihood of replication due to a strong p-value (p<.01) and a very large effect size (ηp² = .23) derived from a standard, simple analysis. While the sample size is small, the visual search paradigm is a classic, high-control method from cognitive psychology, and the finding is a plausible extension of a well-established effect in adults. The main risk is that the small sample may have led to an inflated effect size, but the effect is likely robust enough to be detected in a replication.

0.82
The prediction is high due to the very strong reported evidence, including a low p-value (<.01) and a large effect size (ηp² = .23). Although the sample size is relatively small, the effect's magnitude suggests it is robust and would be readily detectable in a replication. The study's use of a standard cognitive paradigm for a plausible, theory-driven hypothesis further increases confidence in its replicability."

To test this hypothesis, we manipulated the value of stimuli only after participants had encoded them; then, participants assessed the frequencies of the stimuli. A randomization procedure ensured that stimulus value could not be diagnostic of frequency. We did not reveal these frequencies. Participants then learned that they would receive for each previously seen picture from one of the two categories (either birds or flowers). To determine the endowed category, respondents flipped a coin. Next, we asked them to estimate the number of pictures in each category. As predicted, participants were more likely to underestimate the number of flower pictures relative to bird pictures when they expected payment for flower pictures than when they expected payment for bird pictures. In contrast, they were more likely to underestimate the number of bird pictures relative to flower pictures when they expected payment for bird pictures than when they expected payment for flower pictures. Our results implicate a judgment process at the stimulus-retrieval stage, rather than at the encoding stage, because the value difference between the stimulus categories was induced randomly only after the stimuli were presented.

The reported p-value of 0.037 is just below the 0.05 significance threshold, which, combined with the small sample size of 56, makes the finding highly susceptible to sampling error. While the study's design and analysis are straightforward, results with p-values this close to the cutoff often fail to replicate, as the original effect size may be an overestimate. These statistical indicators point to a low probability of a successful replication.
---
0.38
This prediction is low primarily because the p-value (p = 0.037) is very close to the conventional threshold for significance, and such results often fail to replicate. This weak evidence is compounded by the small sample size (N=56), which means the original finding may be statistically fragile or overestimated. While the experimental design is straightforward and the effect size is medium, the combination of a borderline p-value and a small sample casts significant doubt on the robustness of the effect.
---
0.35
This prediction is driven primarily by the small sample size (N=56) and a p‑value (p=.037) that is very close to the conventional significance threshold of .05. Such findings are statistically fragile and have a lower probability of replicating, as the original result may be an overestimation of the true effect. While the use of a simple Chi-squared test is a positive sign, the weak primary evidence makes a successful replication less likely.

The prediction is low primarily due to the combination of a small sample size (N=56) and a p‑value (p=0.037) that is just below the conventional significance threshold. Such ""barely significant"" findings from low‑powered studies are statistically less likely to replicate, as the original result could be due to sampling error and the reported medium effect size is likely an overestimation. The low author citation count also fails to add confidence in the result's robustness.
---
0.35
The reported p-value of 0.037 is very close to the 0.05 threshold, a range that has been shown to have a low replication rate. This weak evidence is coupled with a small sample size (N=56), which increases the likelihood that the original finding was a false positive or that its effect size is overestimated. The mathematical inconsistency between the reported test statistic and the effect size further undermines confidence in the result.

0.35
The primary predictors of low replicability are present: a small sample size (N=56) and a p-value (0.037) that is just below the conventional significance threshold. This combination suggests the study was underpowered and that the reported medium effect size is likely an overestimation, making a successful replication improbable. While the simple chi-squared analysis and straightforward experimental design are positive factors, they do not sufficiently offset the weakness of the statistical evidence."

The very small sample size (N=18) is a primary concern, as findings from such samples are often statistically unstable and have a higher chance of being false positives. While the F-statistic corresponds to a low p-value (p≈.007), the reported effect size is impossibly large and mathematically inconsistent with the test statistic, which raises serious questions about the result's accuracy. These factors combine to suggest a low probability of successful replication despite the strong claim.
---
0.35
The reported statistical evidence is strong (a low p-value and a very large effect size), but the extremely small sample size (N=18) is a major red flag. Small-N studies are known to produce noisy and highly inflated effect size estimates, making the reported `ηp²` of .70 seem implausibly large for a subtle cognitive phenomenon. A well-powered replication would likely find a much smaller effect that may not reach statistical significance.
---
0.70
The very small sample size (N=18) is a major risk factor for replicability, as it can produce unstable and overestimated effect sizes. However, this risk is mitigated by the highly significant p-value (p≈.007, calculated from the F-statistic) and the fact that the finding was reportedly demonstrated across three separate experiments. Therefore, while the true effect is likely smaller than reported, a well-powered replication has a strong chance of detecting it.
---
0.35
The primary reason for the low replication estimate is the extremely small sample size (N=18), which can produce unstable results and highly inflated effect size estimates. Even with a strong p-value (p≈.007, calculated from the F-statistic), the correspondingly large effect size suggests a ""winner's curse"" phenomenon, which is unlikely to be observed again in a higher-powered, more precise replication attempt. The established author is a minor positive factor but does not overcome these fundamental statistical concerns.
---
0.25
The primary reasons for this low prediction are the extremely small sample size (N=18) and the implausibly large reported effect size (partial eta-squared = .7). Such large effects from small samples are often statistical artifacts and are prone to the ""winner's curse,"" where the true effect is much smaller. Although the p-value is low (corresponding to an F-statistic of 9.33), this is insufficient to overcome the high risk of a false positive or inflated effect associated with such a severely underpowered design.
---
0.35
The primary reason for the low replication probability is the extremely small sample size (N=18), which makes the findings statistically fragile and prone to random error. This small sample likely contributed to the impossibly large reported effect size (ηp² = .70), a common phenomenon known as the ""winner's curse"" where initial significant findings from low-powered studies are dramatic overestimates. While the p-value is strong, it is a direct result of this inflated effect size and is not a reliable indicator of replicability given the study's weak foundation."
