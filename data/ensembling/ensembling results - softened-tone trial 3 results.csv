This study's replicability is questionable due to weak statistical evidence, including a small sample size (N=24) and very low error degrees of freedom (df=13), combined with a p-value (0.02) that is close to the significance threshold. Although the finding is from a highly-cited author in cognitive psychology and the reported effect size is large, the low statistical power suggests this effect is likely an overestimation and may not be robust.
---
0.35
The likelihood of replication is low due to a combination of weak statistical evidence. The sample size (N=24) is small, and the reported denominator degrees of freedom (13) are anomalously low for that sample, suggesting very low statistical power. Furthermore, the p-value of 0.02 is close to the significance threshold, and the very large effect size (ηp² = .354) is likely an overestimation, a common issue in underpowered studies.
---
0.45
This prediction balances positive indicators, such as the highly-cited author and a standard cognitive psychology paradigm, with significant statistical weaknesses. The sample size is very small (N=24), and the error degrees of freedom are even lower (df=13), which makes the finding precarious. While the reported effect size is large, this is likely an overestimation due to the small sample, and the p-value (0.02) is close enough to the significance threshold to suggest the result may not be robust to resampling.
---
0.68
The prediction is moderately high primarily because of the very large reported effect size (ηp² = 0.354), which suggests a robust phenomenon that should be detectable. Confidence is tempered, however, by the small sample size (N=24, with only 13 denominator degrees of freedom) and a p-value of 0.02, which is close to the significance threshold. While the large effect is a strong positive indicator, the low statistical power of the original study introduces considerable uncertainty.
---
0.35
The prediction is low due to the combination of a small sample size and a p‑value of 0.02, which is close to the conventional significance threshold. These factors suggest the very large reported effect size (ηp^2 = 0.35) may be inflated, and the result could be a false positive or at least an overestimated effect. Although the first author is highly cited, the weak statistical evidence, including a notable inconsistency between the reported sample size (24) and the test statistic's degrees of freedom (implying N=14), raises significant concerns about replicability."

This study shows strong signals of replicability, including a very low p-value and a very large effect size within a powerful repeated-measures design. The reported finding is the result of a series of converging experiments that systematically isolate the effect and control for artifacts, which suggests a methodologically robust and well-understood phenomenon. While the sample size is small, the strength of the statistical evidence and the careful experimental approach make a successful replication highly likely.
---
0.88
This prediction is high due to the combination of a very strong p-value (<0.005) and an extremely large effect size (partial eta-squared = .374). Although the sample size is small, the use of a powerful within-subjects design (RM ANOVA) makes the finding more credible. The abstract's description of a systematic series of experiments that manipulate the effect at will further suggests that the phenomenon is robust and well-understood by the authors.
---
0.82
This prediction is high due to the very large reported effect size (ηp² = .374) and a strong p-value (p < .005), which suggest a robust phenomenon. While the sample size of 24 is small, the use of a within-subjects design provides greater statistical power, and such a large effect is likely to be detected even with a smaller sample. The study's programmatic nature (a series of experiments) in cognitive psychology, a field with more controlled methods, further increases confidence in the finding.
---
0.62
The reported p-value is strong (<0.005) and the effect size is very large (ηp² = .374), which are both positive indicators of replicability. However, confidence is tempered by the very small sample size (N=24), which increases the likelihood of an inflated effect size and a less stable result. Additionally, the abstract describes the phenomenon as highly sensitive to participant strategy and experimental setup, which can introduce variability and make direct replication more challenging.
---
0.75
This prediction is moderately high due to the combination of a very strong p-value (<.005) and a large effect size (ηp² = .374), which suggest a substantial underlying effect. While the small sample size (N=24) is a significant concern for reliability, this is partially mitigated by the use of a powerful within-subjects (RM ANOVA) design. Furthermore, the paper reports a series of six experiments that build a coherent theoretical case, indicating a systematic investigation rather than a single, fragile finding."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
Although many accounts of task switching emphasize the importance of working memory as a substantial source of the switch cost, there is a lack of evidence demonstrating that task switching actually places additional demands on working memory. The present study addressed this issue by implementing task switching in continuous complex span tasks with strictly controlled time parameters. A series of 4 experiments demonstrate that recall performance decreased as a function of the number of task switches and that the concurrent load of item maintenance had no influence on task switching. These results indicate that task switching induces a cost on working memory functioning. Implications for theories of task switching, working memory, and resource sharing are addressed.

Some subfields—such as social or developmental psychology—have historically shown lower replication rates compared to others like clinical or personality psychology, though individual study quality still matters.",0.45,0.45,0.35,0.72,0.65,0.524,"0.45
The prediction is modest due to the combination of a small sample size (N=25) and a p-value (p≈0.03) that is very close to the .05 significance threshold, suggesting the result is statistically fragile. Although the reported effect size is large and the cognitive psychology subfield tends to replicate relatively well, these weak primary statistics indicate the original effect may be overestimated. A direct replication would face a substantial risk of producing a non-significant result.
---
0.45
The small sample size (N=25) and p-value just under the threshold of significance (p≈0.03) are strong indicators of low replicability, as they suggest the result may be statistically fragile. Although the reported effect size is large, such estimates are often inflated in small samples. The presence of four experiments in the paper is a positive sign of internal consistency, but the weak evidence in this specific test makes a successful replication uncertain.
---
0.35
The low replication probability is primarily due to the small sample size (N=25) and a p-value just under the 0.05 significance threshold, which indicates the finding is statistically fragile. Although the reported effect size is large, such effects are often inflated in small studies and may not be found in a higher-powered replication. The use of a complex MANOVA analysis also introduces flexibility that can reduce the robustness of a finding.

0.72
This study has a moderately high chance of replication. Positive factors include that the finding was demonstrated across a series of four experiments, it comes from the subfield of cognitive psychology which has a higher replication rate, and the author is well-established. The primary risk factor is the small sample size (N=25), which increases the chance that the large reported effect size (ηp^2 = 0.181) is an overestimation and that the p-value is only significant due to sampling error.
---
0.65
The prediction is moderately high due to a reported large effect size and a series of four experiments supporting the conclusion, which suggests the finding is robust. However, this confidence is tempered by the small sample size (N=25) and a p-value that is close to the significance threshold of 0.05, both of which are risk factors for replication failure."

This prediction is based on several strong positive indicators, including a large sample size and a highly significant p-value (p<0.001), which together suggest a robust finding. The study's origin in cognitive psychology, a field known for controlled experimental designs, also increases confidence in its replicability.

While the effect size is modest (ηp² = 0.052) and the mixed ANOVA analysis is complex, the strong statistical evidence from a well-powered study in a generally high-replicability subfield (cognitive psychology) makes a successful replication very likely.

This intermixed-blocked effect may be an example of the superiority of spaced over massed practice; in the intermixed, but not the blocked exposure regime, each presentation of a given stimulus (e.g., AX) is separated from the next by the presentation of its partner (BX). Two experiments with human participants replicated the intermixed-blocked effect and showed that the effect was not due to the spacing of exposure trials. A mechanism for the intermixed-blocked effect is proposed, which combines theories from associative learning and memory.

Key details:
- Sample size: 32
- Analysis type (e.g. rm ANOVA, mixed ANOVA, regression, t‑test): RM ANOVA
- Test statistic: F(1,31) = 8.38
- Reported p‑value: X
- Effect size (e.g. Cohen’s d, r): dz = 0.51
- First author’s citation count: 1387
- Subfield: Cognitive, Social

Note:
Some subfields—such as social or developmental psychology—have historically shown lower replication rates compared to others like clinical or personality psychology, though individual study quality still matters.",0.78,0.76,0.75,0.82,0.85,0.792,"0.78
The prediction is high due to a strong p-value (p≈.007, as calculated from the F-statistic), a plausible medium effect size, and a powerful within-subjects experimental design. Although the sample size of 32 is a notable weakness that could lead to an overestimated effect, the strength of the statistical evidence for a phenomenon described as ""robust"" within cognitive psychology suggests a replication is likely to succeed.
---
0.76
The study reports strong statistical evidence with a p-value of approximately .007 and a plausible, medium-sized effect, which are good predictors of success. While the sample size of 32 is small and may lead to an overestimated effect, this risk is mitigated by the use of a powerful within‑subjects design. The straightforward experimental procedure described and the assertion that the core effect is already ""robust"" further increase the likelihood of a successful replication.
---
0.75
The study reports a strong p-value (calculated from F(1,31)=8.38, p≈.007) for a phenomenon described as robust, which are positive indicators for replication. However, the small sample size (N=32) is a significant weakness, as it increases the chance that the observed medium effect size (dz=0.51) is an overestimate. Overall, the strong statistical evidence and cognitive psychology subfield suggest a good, but not certain, probability of success.
---
0.82
The probability of replication is high due to the strong statistical evidence; the F-statistic implies a p-value far below the standard .05 threshold, a key predictor of success. While the sample size is modest, the powerful within-subjects design was sufficient to detect the reported medium-sized effect (dz = 0.51). The study's focus on a well-established cognitive phenomenon, investigated by an experienced researcher, further increases confidence in the finding's robustness.
---
0.85
The prediction is high because of the strong signal (p≈.007 from the F-statistic, dz=0.51) found using a powerful within-subjects design. Although the sample size of 32 is modest, the plausible medium effect size, internal replication mentioned in the abstract, and the study's grounding in cognitive psychology suggest the finding is robust. These factors collectively outweigh the risk associated with the smaller sample."

This study has a strong chance of replication due to its very low p-value (0.002) and large effect size (dz = 0.724), which suggest a robust statistical finding. The simple t-test analysis also reduces the risk of non-replicability from complex or flexible methods. However, confidence is tempered by the small sample size (N=24), which makes the effect size estimate less stable and more susceptible to being an overestimate of the true effect.

0.82
This study has a high likelihood of replication due to its very small p-value (0.002) and large reported effect size (dz = 0.724), which together suggest a robust finding. The main source of uncertainty is the small sample size (N=24), which can produce inflated and less stable effect size estimates, even when statistically significant. However, the straightforward statistical analysis (t-test) and cognitive psychology subject matter, a subfield with a relatively good replication history, bolster confidence in the result.
---
0.78
This study’s high likelihood of replication is driven by its strong statistical evidence (p=0.002, dz=0.724) and simple, transparent analysis (dependent t-test). Although the small sample size (N=24) is a significant weakness that could lead to an overestimated effect, the very low p-value for a core cognitive phenomenon suggests the finding is robust and not a statistical fluke. The simple analysis also reduces concerns about hidden researcher flexibility that can inflate results.
---
0.75
The low p-value (0.002) and large reported effect size (dz = 0.724) are the strongest positive predictors for a successful replication. While the small sample size (N=24) is a significant concern that can lead to inflated effect size estimates, the very simple analysis (t-test) and the study's basis in cognitive psychology—a subfield with relatively robust findings—increase confidence. The statistical evidence is strong enough that the effect would likely replicate, even if its magnitude is smaller than originally reported.
---
0.62
The reported p-value is very low (0.002) and the effect size is large, which are strong positive predictors of replicability. However, the primary concern is the small sample size (N=24), which suggests the observed effect size may be an overestimation. A replication with a similar N might be underpowered to detect the likely smaller true effect, tempering the overall probability of success."

This study has a very high probability of successful replication due to its extremely strong statistical evidence, including a very low p-value (<.001) and a large effect size (ηp² = .32). While the sample size of 39 is relatively small, the magnitude of the reported effect is so large that it is very unlikely to be a false positive and should be readily detectable in a new sample. The study's use of a standard, controlled laboratory experiment in a core area of psychology further increases its likely replicability.

0.88
This study has a high probability of replication due to the very strong statistical evidence (p<.001) and the large reported effect size (ηp² = .32). Although the sample size is small, confidence is increased by the fact that the authors reported three successful experiments, which serves as a form of internal replication. The experimental paradigm, which draws on well-established concepts in cognitive and social psychology, is also straightforward to implement.
---
0.85
The reported p-value is very low (p<.001) and the effect size is very large (ηp² = .32), which are the strongest indicators of a successful replication. While the sample size of 39 is relatively small, such a large effect is likely to be robust and easily detectable in a follow-up study. The straightforward ANOVA analysis and the study’s grounding in a classic cognitive paradigm also support a high likelihood of replication.
---
0.85
The study reports a very strong signal, indicated by the highly significant p-value (p < .001) and the large effect size (ηp² = .32), which are powerful predictors of replication success. Although the small sample size (N=39) raises concerns about potential effect size inflation, the statistical evidence for this well-established type of memory effect is compelling. A successful replication is therefore highly probable, as the original effect is robust enough to likely be detected even if its true size is smaller than what was reported.
---
0.88
The prediction is high because the study reports a very low p‑value (<.001) and a very large effect size (ηp² = .32), both strong indicators of a robust and replicable finding. While the sample size is modest, the effect's sheer magnitude suggests it is not a statistical artifact and should be readily observable in a new study. The controlled experimental design, investigating a well-established type of memory bias, further increases confidence."

The authors investigated semantic neighborhood density effects on visual word processing to examine the dynamics of activation and competition among semantic representations. Experiment 1 validated feature-based semantic representations as a basis for computing semantic neighborhood density and suggested that near and distant neighbors have opposite effects on word processing. Experiment 2 confirmed these results: Word processing was slower for dense near neighborhoods and faster for dense distant neighborhoods. Analysis of a computational model showed that attractor dynamics can produce this pattern of neighborhood effects. The authors argue for reconsideration of traditional models of neighborhood effects in terms of attractor dynamics, which allow both inhibitory and facilitative effects to emerge.

Key details:
- Sample size: 22
- Analysis type (e.g. rm ANOVA, mixed ANOVA, regression, t‑test): RM ANOVA
- Test statistic: F(1, 21) = 17.3
- Reported p‑value: <.001
- Effect size (e.g. Cohen’s d, r): __p^2 = .452
- First author’s citation count: 1002
- Subfield: Cognitive, Social

Note:
Higher citation counts for the first author may reflect greater research experience or methodological rigor, which can be modestly associated with increased replication success.","# System

Although the sample size is very small, the finding is supported by an extremely low p-value (<.001), a very large effect size (ηp² = .452), and an internal replication within the paper. The within-subjects design (RM ANOVA) is statistically powerful, which can partially compensate for the small number of participants. While the true effect size is likely smaller than reported, the strength of the evidence suggests the effect is real and would likely replicate.

This study reports a highly significant p-value (<.001) and a very large effect size (ηp² = .452), which on their own would suggest a high likelihood of replication. However, the sample size is very small (N=22), which is a major weakness that increases the risk of the reported effect size being inflated. The use of a powerful within-subjects design in a controlled cognitive paradigm is a positive factor, but the small sample remains the primary source of uncertainty.

0.70
The prediction is moderately high due to the very strong reported evidence (p < .001, ηp² = .452) from a powerful within‑subjects design. However, the extremely small sample size (N=22) is a major concern, as results from such studies can be unstable and effect sizes can be overestimated. While the cognitive lab setting and strong statistics are positive indicators, the small sample introduces significant uncertainty about the true effect size, tempering the overall prediction.
---
0.78
The study's extremely low p-value (p<.001) and large F-statistic provide strong evidence against a null effect, making replication success probable. However, the very small sample size (N=22) suggests the reported effect size (ηp²=.452) is substantially inflated and would be smaller in a replication. The within-subjects design and experienced author provide additional modest support for the finding's robustness.
---
0.85
The prediction is high due to exceptionally strong statistical evidence, including a very low p-value (p<.001) and a large effect size (ηp²=.452). Confidence is further bolstered by an internal replication (Experiment 2) and the study's basis in cognitive psychology, which has a relatively strong replication record. Although the sample size (N=22) is very small, the sheer magnitude of the reported effect makes a successful replication likely."

The primary concern for replication is the weak statistical evidence; the F-statistic yields a p-value just below the .05 threshold (p≈.048), which is a strong negative predictor. This is compounded by the relatively small sample size for a mixed ANOVA design testing an interaction effect, suggesting the study was likely underpowered. While the reported medium effect size is a positive indicator, it may be an overestimation due to the low statistical power.
---
0.35
The key predictor of low replicability is the p-value, which is just under the .05 significance threshold; the F-statistic yields a p-value of approximately .048. Such borderline results have a low probability of replicating successfully. Furthermore, the finding is a specific interaction from a mixed ANOVA, and these complex effects are often less robust than simpler main effects, despite the reported medium effect size.
---
0.35
The prediction is low because the p-value is just below the .05 significance threshold, a strong negative predictor for replicability. This weak evidence, combined with a small sample size for a complex mixed ANOVA, suggests the study may be underpowered and the reported medium effect size is likely an overestimation. Furthermore, specific interaction effects, like the one found here, are often more difficult to replicate than simpler main effects.
---
0.38
The probability of replication is low primarily due to weak statistical evidence; the p-value is just under the .05 threshold, and the sample size of 48 is small for detecting a mixed ANOVA interaction. Although the reported effect size is medium and the cognitive paradigm is well-controlled, the fragility of the initial result suggests it may not be robust. The moderate author citation count does little to offset these statistical concerns.
---
0.45
The strongest negative predictor is the p-value, which is just under the .05 threshold, suggesting the result is fragile. Although the reported effect size is medium, the moderate sample size (N=48) provides low statistical power for a mixed ANOVA interaction, meaning a direct replication has a high chance of yielding a non-significant result. The study's foundation in cognitive psychology, which has a better replication history than some other subfields, slightly increases confidence but does not outweigh the statistical weaknesses."

The prediction is high due to an extremely large effect size (__p^2 = 0.55) and a correspondingly low p‑value (<.001), which are the strongest indicators of replicability.

The reported effect size (partial η² = 0.55) and the associated F-statistic are exceptionally large, signaling a very strong and easily detectable effect. While the sample size of 36 is small, the sheer magnitude of the reported statistics suggests the finding is robust and would have very high statistical power, making a successful replication highly probable. The very low p-value and the first author's high citation count are also positive indicators for replicability.

This study reports a very low p-value and an extremely large effect size, which are strong positive predictors of replication success. However, these results are derived from a very small sample (N=36), which can lead to inflated effect size estimates and unstable findings.

The study reports a very low p-value (<.001), a large test statistic, and an extremely large effect size (ηp² = 0.55), suggesting a powerful effect that should be detectable even with a small sample. While the sample size of 36 is a potential weakness, this concern is substantially mitigated by the study's design, which includes three separate experiments that provide internal replication for the core finding."

Some subfields—such as social or developmental psychology—have historically shown lower replication rates compared to others like clinical or personality psychology, though individual study quality still matters.",0.45,0.4,0.35,0.42,0.32,0.388,"0.45
The primary drivers for this lower replication estimate are the small effect size (d = 0.198) and the p-value (0.028), which is very close to the conventional 0.05 threshold. Such a combination suggests the original study was underpowered to reliably detect this subtle effect, meaning a replication attempt has a high chance of yielding a non-significant result. While the sample size is moderate and the analysis is simple, the weak statistical evidence is the most critical factor.
---
0.40
The primary drivers for this prediction are the p-value of 0.028, which is only slightly below the standard significance threshold, and the small reported effect size (d = 0.198). This combination suggests the original study may have been underpowered, and findings with such marginal statistical significance are more likely to be influenced by sampling error. While the sample size of 95 is adequate and the analysis is simple, the weak evidence for a small effect makes a successful replication less probable.
---
0.35
The primary drivers for this prediction are the reported p-value (0.028), which is close to the conventional significance threshold, and the small effect size (d = 0.198). Such marginally significant findings for small effects often fail to replicate because the original result may be a fragile overestimate of the true effect. While the analysis is simple and the sample size is decent for a within-subjects design, the weak statistical evidence suggests a low probability of a successful replication.
---
0.42
The primary reason for this prediction is the weak statistical evidence; the p-value (0.028) is just below the conventional 0.05 threshold and the effect size is small (d = 0.198). This finding is statistically fragile, particularly because the reported t-statistic would not be significant with a more standard two-tailed test. While the study uses a standard cognitive paradigm, the small magnitude of the effect makes it difficult to replicate reliably without a much larger sample size.
---
0.32
The primary concern is the p-value (0.028), which is very close to the 0.05 threshold, suggesting the statistical evidence is weak. This is compounded by the small effect size (d = 0.198), which is difficult to detect reliably and suggests the original study may have been underpowered. While the sample size is moderate and the analysis is simple, the combination of a marginal p‑value and a small effect makes a successful replication unlikely."

Despite a small sample size, the study reports a very low p-value (p < .001) and a large effect size (ηp² = 0.186). These strong statistical results, combined with a powerful within-subjects design (RM ANOVA) and a topic in cognitive psychology (which tends to replicate well), suggest the underlying effect is robust. Therefore, a successful replication is quite likely, as the strong signal should be detectable even with the risk associated with a small initial sample.

0.88
The prediction is high due to the combination of a very small p‑value (p < .001) and a large effect size (ηp² = 0.186), which together signal a robust finding. While the sample size of 39 is small, it is sufficiently powered to detect an effect of this magnitude, especially within a powerful repeated‑measures ANOVA design. These strong statistical signals from a controlled cognitive experiment suggest a high likelihood of successful replication.

The study reports a very strong p-value (<.001) and a large effect size (η_p^2 = 0.186), which strongly favor successful replication. However, this evidence is derived from a small sample size (N=39), introducing significant uncertainty and raising the possibility that the effect size is overestimated. While the highly-cited author and standard analysis (RM ANOVA) are positive signs, the small sample remains a major concern that tempers the otherwise optimistic statistical results.

This study's very low p-value (<.001) and large reported effect size (ηp² = 0.186) are strong positive indicators for replicability. While the sample size is small, the use of a powerful within-subjects design (RM ANOVA) mitigates this concern. The experienced first author and a straightforward computerized task also suggest the finding is likely to be robust.

This study has a high probability of successful replication due to its very strong statistical evidence, including a highly significant p-value (<.001) and a large effect size (ηp² = .31). The study is in cognitive psychology, a subfield with more robust findings, and uses a powerful within-subjects design. Although the sample size (N=32) is relatively small, the strength of the reported effect suggests it is likely a genuine and replicable phenomenon.

This study has a high likelihood of replication due to the convergence of strong statistical evidence, including a very small p-value (<.001) and a large effect size (ηp² = .31). While the sample size is modest, the use of a high-powered, within-subjects design in cognitive psychology—a subfield with a solid replication history—suggests the finding is robust. The high citation count of the first author may also indicate a well-established and reliable research program.
---
0.88
The prediction for high replicability is primarily driven by the very large reported effect size (ηp² = .31) and the correspondingly low p-value (p < .001). While the sample size is modest, it is sufficient for a within-subjects design to detect such a strong effect with high statistical power. The study’s foundation in a controlled, classic cognitive psychology paradigm (memory and serial position) further increases confidence in the stability of the finding.

0.85
This study has a high likelihood of replication due to its very low p-value (<.001) and large reported effect size (ηp² = .31), which suggest a robust phenomenon. While the sample size is small, the study's focus in cognitive psychology and the first author's high citation count provide additional confidence in the finding. The primary risk is that the small sample may have produced a slightly inflated effect size, but the strength of the initial evidence is compelling.
---
0.92
The prediction is high due to the combination of a very low p-value (<.001) and a large reported effect size (ηp² = .31), which are the strongest statistical predictors of replicability. While the sample size is relatively small, the use of a within-subjects design (RM ANOVA) provides high statistical power for an effect of this magnitude. The study’s origin in cognitive psychology, a subfield with a comparatively strong replication record, further bolsters this confidence."

The prediction is relatively low because the reported p-value is close to the .05 significance threshold and the effect size is small-to-medium (ηp²=.05), factors strongly associated with lower replicability. Although the sample size is adequate and the study is in cognitive psychology (a higher-replicability subfield), the key finding is a specific interaction effect, which is often less robust than a main effect. These statistical weaknesses suggest a non-trivial chance the original result was a false positive or an overestimated effect.
---
0.55
This prediction is cautious due to the combination of a small effect size (η² = .05) and a p-value that is not highly significant (p≈.028). Although the sample size (N=96) is decent and cognitive psychology studies tend to replicate relatively well, findings with these statistical characteristics are often fragile. The fact that the key result is a statistical interaction, which can be more difficult to reproduce than a main effect, also tempers the estimate.
---
0.38
The key finding has a p-value that is close to the .05 threshold (p≈.028, calculated from the F-statistic) and represents a small-to-medium effect size (η²=.05). Although the sample size (N=96) is reasonable, the original study was underpowered to reliably detect a nuanced interaction of this size, which increases the likelihood that the original result was a false positive or an overestimated effect. The use of a more complex mixed ANOVA to find this specific interaction can also reduce replicability.
---
0.35
This prediction is relatively low due to several risk factors. The reported p-value is close to the conventional .05 threshold and the effect size is small (η²=.05), both of which are associated with lower replicability. Furthermore, the key finding is a specific interaction effect that was only observed in one of three reported experiments, suggesting the phenomenon may be fragile or context-dependent.
---
0.40
The primary drivers for this prediction are the small effect size (η²=.05) and a p‑value that, while reported as <.05, is calculated to be p≈.028 from the F‑statistic. Such weak evidence for a small effect suggests a notable chance of a false positive or an overestimated effect, which have a lower probability of replicating. While the sample size is adequate for a cognitive lab study, the finding's specificity—appearing in only one of three experiments—suggests the effect may be fragile and highly dependent on specific operationalizations."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
It has been claimed that bilingualism enhances inhibitory control, but the available evidence is equivocal. The authors evaluated several possible versions of the inhibition hypothesis by comparing monolinguals and bilinguals with regard to stop signal performance, inhibition of return, and the attentional blink. These three phenomena, it can be argued, tap into different aspects of inhibition. Monolinguals and bilinguals did not differ in stop signal reaction time and thus were comparable in terms of active-inhibitory efficiency. However, bilinguals showed no facilitation from spatial cues, showed a strong inhibition of return effect, and exhibited a more pronounced attentional blink. These results suggest that bilinguals do not differ from monolinguals in terms of active inhibition but have acquired a better ability to maintain action goals and to use them to bias goal-related information. Under some circumstances, this ability may indirectly lead to more pronounced reactive inhibition of irrelevant information.

Key details:
- Sample size: 18
- Analysis type (e.g. rm ANOVA, mixed ANOVA, regression, t‑test): RM ANOVA
- Test statistic: F(3, 93) = 5.23
- Reported p‑value: 0.002
- Effect size (e.g. Cohen’s d, r): MSE = .009
- First author’s citation count: 2307
- Subfield: Cognitive, Social

Note:
Some subfields—such as social or developmental psychology—have historically shown lower replication rates compared to others like clinical or personality psychology, though individual study quality still matters.",0.25,0.22,0.15,0.15,0.25,0.204,"0.25
The primary concern is the extremely small sample size (N=18), which yields low statistical power and unstable estimates that are unlikely to be robust. While the p-value is impressively low, significant results from underpowered studies often reflect inflated effect sizes and have a low probability of replication. The complex pattern of findings across multiple tasks in a research area known for inconsistent results (the ""bilingual advantage"") further lowers the chances of a successful replication.

The primary concern is the extremely small sample size (N=18), which is severely underpowered for a study comparing groups and makes the findings highly susceptible to noise. While the reported p‑value is very low, achieving such strong results from a tiny sample is often a statistical artifact of overestimated effects, especially in a contentious field like bilingualism research where findings are notoriously mixed. The complexity of the results, showing a nuanced pattern across three different tasks, further reduces the chances of a successful replication.
---
0.15
The primary reason for the low replication probability is the extremely small sample size (N=18), which provides very low statistical power and produces unstable estimates. Furthermore, there is a critical inconsistency between the reported sample size and the ANOVA's degrees of freedom (F(3, 93)), which undermines the credibility of the analysis. While the p-value is low, this is less convincing given the small sample and the fact that the research topic (the bilingual advantage) is known for conflicting results and replication challenges.
---
0.15
A sample size of 18 is extremely small for comparing groups and is a primary indicator of low replicability. Furthermore, the reported degrees of freedom for the F-test (df=93) are mathematically impossible for a sample of this size, suggesting a critical error in the original analysis or report. While the p‑value is low, these fundamental statistical issues, combined with the study being in a field known for mixed findings, make a successful replication highly unlikely.
---
0.25
The prediction is low primarily due to the extremely small sample size (N=18), which results in low statistical power and a high risk that the significant finding is a Type I error or a vastly overestimated effect. Furthermore, the topic of cognitive advantages of bilingualism is known for its mixed and conflicting results, and the complex pattern of findings in the abstract suggests a fragile effect that is difficult to replicate consistently. While the p-value is low, this is not sufficient to overcome the fundamental weakness of an underpowered design."

The prediction is high due to a combination of strong statistical evidence and a solid study design. The reported p‑value is very low (p<.001) from a large sample size (N=154), and the test statistic (F=23.176) implies a large effect size, all of which are key predictors of replicability. While priming effects can sometimes be fragile, the robustness of these metrics suggests this specific cognitive finding is likely to replicate successfully.

This study has a high probability of successful replication due to its very strong statistical evidence, including a p-value <.001 and a large F-statistic that implies a large effect size. The sample size of 154 is substantial for a repeated-measures design, providing high statistical power to detect the effect. Furthermore, the use of a standard, controlled laboratory priming paradigm from cognitive psychology increases the likelihood that the finding is robust.

The prediction for high replicability is based on several strong positive indicators. The reported p-value is very low (<.001) and the F-statistic is large (F(1, 152) = 23.176), which correspond to a medium-to-large effect size and are strongly associated with replication success. Furthermore, the sample size (N=154) is substantial for a within-subjects cognitive experiment, and the finding was demonstrated across two separate experiments in the original paper, suggesting internal robustness.

This prediction is high due to the combination of a large sample size (N=154) and very strong statistical evidence, including a highly significant p-value (<.001) and a large F-statistic that implies a medium-to-large effect size. Although interaction effects in priming studies can sometimes be fragile, the robust result from a well-powered, within-subjects cognitive experiment makes a successful replication very likely. The high author citation count also provides a minor boost in confidence.

This study has a high probability of successful replication due to its strong statistical evidence and sound methodology. The sample size is quite large for a cognitive psychology experiment, and the very low p-value (<.001) and high F-statistic suggest a robust, medium-to-large effect size that is not a statistical artifact. Furthermore, the use of a controlled, classic laboratory priming paradigm by a highly-cited author adds confidence in the result's reliability."

The reported p-value is very low (<.001) and the effect size is very large (d=1.51), suggesting a strong and easily detectable signal. The study builds upon the Hebb repetition effect, which is described as a well-replicated phenomenon, increasing the a priori plausibility of the finding. However, the very small sample size (N=24) is a major concern, as it often leads to inflated and unstable effect estimates, which reduces confidence in a successful replication.

This study has a high likelihood of replication due to its extremely large effect size (d = 1.51) and highly significant p-value (p < .001). While the sample size of 24 is small, such a powerful effect should be readily detectable, particularly within a cognitive psychology paradigm known for robust findings. The study also extends a well-established phenomenon (the Hebb repetition effect), which further increases confidence in the core finding.

0.88
This prediction is high due to the very strong evidence reported: an extremely low p-value (p < .001) and a very large effect size (d = 1.51). Although the sample size is small (N=24), the finding is a variation on a robust, well-established cognitive paradigm, which increases confidence that the effect is real. While the reported effect size may be overestimated due to the small sample, the underlying phenomenon is likely strong enough to produce a significant result in a replication attempt.

This study has a very high probability of successful replication due to its extremely low p-value (<.001) and very large effect size (d=1.51), which are strong predictors of reproducibility. Although the sample size is small, the finding is an extension of a robust, well-documented cognitive effect (the Hebb effect) and was tested with a powerful within-subjects design. These factors collectively suggest the result is not a statistical artifact and would be found again.

Changes in reading processes were assessed by measuring the effect of predictable switches between stimulus categories across trials.

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
Recent evidence suggests that the processes responsible for generating a phonological code from print are flexible in skilled readers. An important goal, therefore, is to identify the conditions that lead to changes in how a phonological code is computed. Five experiments are reported that examine whether phonological processes change as predicted by the pathway control hypothesis when reading aloud words and nonwords. Changes in reading processes were assessed by measuring the effect of predictable switches between stimulus categories across trials. The results of the present experiments are argued to be consistent with the pathway control hypothesis.

Key details:
- Sample size: 16
- Analysis type (e.g. rm ANOVA, mixed ANOVA, regression, t‑test): mixed ANOVA
- Test statistic: F(1, 94) = 2.5
- Reported p‑value: >0.1
- Effect size (e.g. Cohen’s d, r): _^2 = .026
- First author’s citation count: 462

Larger sample sizes generally contribute to more stable and replicable findings, though overall replicability depends on a combination of factors.","# System

This study has a very low probability of successful replication, defined as achieving a significant result (p < .05). The original study itself reported a non-significant finding (p > 0.1) with a tiny effect size (η² = .026). Combined with an extremely small sample size (N=16), the original experiment was severely underpowered, and its results are likely due to noise, suggesting the true effect is very small or null.

0.12
The original study failed to find a statistically significant effect (p > 0.1) and was severely underpowered due to its very small sample size (N=16). The reported effect size is also small (η² = .026), providing little evidence for a meaningful underlying effect. Consequently, an independent replication is highly unlikely to achieve a statistically significant result.
---
0.1
The probability of a successful replication is very low. The most critical factor is the reported p‑value of >0.1, which indicates the original study did not find a statistically significant effect, making it highly unlikely a replication would. This issue is compounded by a very small sample size (N=16) and a small effect size (η² = .026), a combination that results in low statistical power and unreliable findings.

0.15
The original study reported a non-significant result (p > 0.1), meaning there is no statistically significant effect to replicate. This finding, combined with a very small sample size (N=16) and a small effect size (η² = .026), indicates the study was severely underpowered. Consequently, it is highly unlikely that a replication attempt would find a statistically significant effect.
---
0.05
The original study failed to find a statistically significant effect (p > 0.1), which is the most critical factor suggesting a replication will also fail to find a significant effect. This result is unsurprising given the very small sample size (N=16) and the small associated effect size (η² = .026). Together, these characteristics indicate a severely underpowered study with unreliable findings, making a successful replication extremely unlikely."

This study has a high risk of non-replication due to the combination of a small sample size (N=32) and a p-value (0.03) that is only marginally below the conventional threshold for significance. While the reported effect size is large, findings from underpowered studies with borderline p-values are often inflated. The complexity of the interaction-based claim may also make the specific result difficult to reproduce, despite the controlled experimental design.
---
0.45
The prediction is cautious because the p-value of 0.03 is close to the significance threshold, which is often associated with lower replicability. While the reported effect size is large (ηp² = .143), such estimates can be inflated in small samples (N=32). These factors suggesting lower certainty temper the positive indicators of a controlled cognitive psychology design and an experienced author.
---
0.35
The reported p-value of .03 is precariously close to the significance threshold, and the small sample size (N=32) suggests the study had low statistical power. This combination makes it likely that the large reported effect size is inflated and that a replication attempt could easily yield a non-significant result due to random sampling variation. The complexity of the reported findings, which distinguish between effects on means and distributional characteristics, may also pose a challenge for exact replication.
---
0.35
This prediction is low due to the combination of a small sample size (N=32) and a p-value (p=.03) that is only slightly below the conventional significance threshold. While the reported effect size is large and the study is in cognitive psychology, a field with a higher-than-average replication rate, weak evidence from small samples is a strong predictor of replication failure. The reported large effect is likely an overestimation, and a replication attempt could easily yield a smaller, non-significant result.
---
0.42
The primary concern is the p-value of 0.03, which is just below the 0.05 significance threshold and is a strong negative predictor of replicability. Although the reported effect size is large, the small sample size (N=32) suggests the study was underpowered, and the effect size estimate is likely inflated due to the ""winner's curse."" The combination of a marginal p-value and a small sample size substantially lowers the probability of a successful replication, despite the standard cognitive paradigm."

In one naming condition, the pictures and words were presented simultaneously on every trial, and participants produced the target response immediately. In the other naming condition, the presentation of the picture preceded the presentation of the distractor by 1,000 ms, and participants delayed production of their naming response until distractor word presentation. Within each naming condition, the distractor words were either semantic category coordinates of the target pictures or unrelated. Orthogonal to this manipulation of semantic relatedness, the frequency of the pictures' names was manipulated. The authors observed semantic interference effects in both the immediate and delayed naming conditions but a frequency effect only in the immediate naming condition. These data indicate that semantic interference can be observed when target picture naming latencies do not reflect the bottleneck at the level of lexical selection. In the context of other findings from the picture-word interference paradigm, the authors interpret these data as supporting the view that the semantic interference effect arises at a postlexical level of processing.

The primary reason for the low replication probability is the reported p-value of <.06, which fails to meet the conventional threshold for statistical significance (p < .05). This marginal result, combined with a small sample size of 32, suggests the original study was underpowered and the finding is likely unstable. Although the reported effect size is large, such estimates are often inflated in underpowered studies with borderline p-values, making a successful replication improbable.

The study’s reported p-value of <.06 is not statistically significant under the conventional p<.05 threshold, which is a very strong indicator of low replicability. This weak evidence, combined with the small sample size, suggests that the large reported effect size is likely an overestimation due to statistical noise. An independent replication is therefore highly unlikely to find a significant effect.

The primary reason for the low replication probability is the reported p-value of <.06, which fails to meet the conventional threshold for statistical significance and suggests very weak evidence. Although the reported effect size is large, this estimate is likely noisy and imprecise given the small sample size. A finding that is only ""marginally significant"" in the original study is very likely to produce a non-significant result in a direct replication.

The primary reason for the low replication probability is that the reported p-value of <.06 is not statistically significant by conventional standards (p<.05). This non-significant result, obtained from a small sample (N=32), indicates the study was underpowered and that the reported large effect size is likely inflated. A replication is therefore very unlikely to find a statistically significant effect.

The primary reason for the low replication probability is the reported p-value of <.06, which fails to meet the conventional threshold for statistical significance (p<.05). This marginal finding, based on a small sample size and a borderline F-statistic, suggests the result is not robust and the large reported effect size is likely a fragile overestimation. While the within-subjects design is a methodological strength, it is unlikely to overcome the fundamental weakness of an initial finding that was not statistically significant."

The primary reasons for the low replication estimate are the extremely small sample size (N=8) and a p-value (p=.023) that is only marginally significant. This combination leads to low statistical power and a high probability that the observed effect is either a false positive or a substantial overestimation of a true effect. While the author is established and the analysis is simple, these statistical weaknesses present a major challenge to replicability.

0.25
The probability of replication is low primarily due to the extremely small sample size (N=8), which results in low statistical power and a high risk of a spurious finding. Furthermore, the p‑value is only barely significant (p=0.023), and a major inconsistency between the reported t‑statistic and the effect size (ηp^2) suggests reporting errors that severely undermine the study's credibility. While the implied effect size is large, the combination of these negative factors makes a successful replication unlikely.

The probability of successful replication is low primarily due to the extremely small sample size (N=8) and the marginal p-value (p=0.023), which is just below the standard significance threshold. Such a small sample provides very low statistical power and leads to an imprecise, likely inflated, effect size estimate. While the simple t-test analysis is a positive factor, the statistical weakness of the original evidence makes it unlikely to be robust.

The primary reasons for the low replication probability are the extremely small sample size (N=8) and a p-value (p=.023) that is only barely below the conventional significance threshold of .05. While the reported effect size is large, estimates from such small samples are highly imprecise and often inflated. These factors suggest the original finding is statistically fragile and at high risk of being a false positive, making a successful replication unlikely despite the simple analysis and experienced author.

The prediction is low primarily due to the extremely small sample size (N=8), which yields low statistical power and makes the findings highly susceptible to sampling error. Furthermore, the p-value of 0.023 is just below the conventional significance threshold, and such results have been shown to replicate less often. While the implied effect size is large, the tiny sample makes this estimate unreliable and likely inflated."

The very large effect size (ηp² = .427) and highly significant p-value (p < .001) are strong predictors of a successful replication. Although the sample size is modest, the use of a statistically powerful within-subjects design (RM ANOVA) increases confidence in the stability of the finding. The combination of a very strong signal and an efficient experimental design suggests the effect is robust and likely to be found again.

The prediction is high due to the very strong statistical evidence: an extremely low p‑value (p<.001) and a very large effect size (ηp² = .427). These metrics suggest a robust phenomenon that should be readily detectable even in a replication with a modest sample. Although the original sample size (N=37) is small, which can sometimes lead to overestimated effects, the sheer magnitude of the reported effect and the within‑subjects design make a successful replication highly probable.

This study has a very high probability of replication due to its extremely large effect size (ηp² = .427) and a correspondingly low p‑value (<.001). Although the sample size (N=37) is small, the sheer magnitude of the reported effect and the use of a powerful within‑subjects design suggest a robust phenomenon. An experienced first author and the cognitive psychology subfield, which often deals with strong experimental effects, further support a positive outlook.

This prediction is high due to very strong statistical evidence, including a low p‑value (0.001) and a medium‑to‑large effect size (d=0.6). The study relies on a powerful within‑subjects design with a simple analysis (paired t‑test), and the standard cognitive paradigm is straightforward to replicate, minimizing potential sources of error.

This prediction is high due to a convergence of positive factors. The study reports a strong p‑value (p=0.001) and a medium‑to‑large effect size (d=0.6), which together signal a robust finding unlikely to be a statistical fluke. Furthermore, the use of a simple paired t‑test in a controlled cognitive experiment with a within‑subjects design increases confidence, as these study types are often more powerful and less prone to hidden analytical complexity than other designs.

This study has a high probability of replication due to several strong indicators: the reported p-value is very low (0.001), the effect size is medium-to-large (d=0.6), and the reported statistics are internally consistent. The use of a simple paired t-test minimizes analytical flexibility, and the sample size of 40 is adequate for a well-powered within-subjects design like this one. The controlled, laboratory-based nature of a cognitive memory experiment further bolsters confidence in the robustness of the finding.

The prediction is high due to the combination of a very low p-value (0.001) and a medium-to-large effect size (d=0.6), which are strong indicators of a robust finding. For a within-subjects design, the sample size of 40 provides very high statistical power to detect an effect of this magnitude. The simple analysis (paired t-test) and the cognitive psychology subfield, which generally has higher replication rates, further increase confidence in a successful replication.

The study reports a very strong statistical signal, with a highly significant p-value (p<.01) and an extremely large effect size (ηp² = .51). While such a large effect found in a very small sample (N=24) is likely an overestimation, the signal is strong enough to suggest a genuine underlying phenomenon is present. Therefore, a successful replication is probable, even if it yields a more modest effect size.

The very small sample size (N=24) is a significant concern and typically increases the risk of replication failure. However, this is strongly counteracted by the extremely large reported effect size (ηp² = .51) and the robust p-value. Most importantly, the abstract states the finding was replicated across five experiments, which provides strong internal evidence for the effect's reliability and suggests a high probability of successful independent replication.

Although the small sample size (N=24) is a concern and suggests the massive effect size (ηp² = .51) may be inflated, the result is highly likely to replicate. The reported p‑value is extremely low (p < .01 for F(1,20)=20.79), providing very strong statistical evidence against the null hypothesis. Furthermore, the abstract mentions this finding is supported by a series of 5 experiments, which implies strong internal replication and robustness.

The prediction is high due to the exceptionally strong statistical evidence; the p‑value is low (<.01) and the effect size is massive (ηp² = .51). While the very small sample size (N=24) is a major concern that likely inflated the effect size estimate, the signal is so powerful that a successful replication remains probable. The experienced author and core cognitive topic are also modest positive indicators.

While the sample size is very small and the effect size is likely inflated, several factors suggest a good chance of replication success. The reported p-value and F-statistic are very strong, indicating a clear signal in the original data. Most importantly, the abstract notes the paper contains five experiments demonstrating the effect, which constitutes a robust internal replication series and substantially increases confidence in the reliability of the finding."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
Given a changing visual environment, and the limited capacity of visual working memory (VWM), the contents of VWM must be in constant flux. Using a change detection task, the authors show that VWM is subject to obligatory updating in the face of new information. Change detection performance is enhanced when the item that may change is retrospectively cued 1 s after memory encoding and 0.5 s before testing. The retro-cue benefit cannot be explained by memory decay or by a reduction in interference from other items held in VWM. Rather, orienting attention to a single memory item makes VWM more resistant to interference from the test probe. The authors conclude that the content of VWM is volatile unless it receives focused attention, and that the standard change detection task underestimates VWM capacity.

This prediction is low due to the extremely small sample size (N=12), which produces unstable estimates and low statistical power. Furthermore, the reported p-value is questionable, as the F-statistic corresponds to a p-value just over the standard .05 threshold, making this a fragile and potentially misreported finding. While the observed effect size is large, it is likely an overestimation common in underpowered studies, and a replication is unlikely to achieve statistical significance.
---
0.25
The primary reasons for this low prediction are the extremely small sample size (N=12) and the p‑value being just at the .05 threshold for significance. A sample this small has very low statistical power, which makes the results unstable and likely inflates the reported large effect size. A fragile, “just significant” p‑value from an underpowered study has a high probability of being a false positive, making a successful replication unlikely.
---
0.32
This study's probability of replication is low due to the combination of an extremely small sample size (N=12) and a p-value that is just at the threshold for statistical significance (p≈.05). This suggests the very large reported effect size is likely inflated and that the original finding is statistically fragile. Although the cognitive paradigm and analysis are standard, the statistical evidence is too weak to expect a successful replication.
---
0.22
This study has a very low probability of replication success primarily due to its extremely small sample size (N=12) and a p-value that is right at the threshold of significance (p≈.05). Small samples produce unstable estimates and have low statistical power, meaning the original result could be a false positive or the very large reported effect size is likely inflated. While the cognitive paradigm is standard, the statistical evidence presented is exceptionally weak and unlikely to be reproduced in a new sample.
---
0.35
This prediction is low due to the combination of an extremely small sample size (N=12) and a p-value on the borderline of statistical significance; in fact, the reported F‑statistic corresponds to a p‑value slightly above .05. While the reported effect size is large, such estimates from underpowered studies are often inflated and unlikely to be observed in a replication. The finding's statistical foundation is weak, significantly increasing the risk of replication failure despite the standard cognitive paradigm."

The reported test statistic (z = 3.10) implies a low p-value, which is a positive sign for replicability. However, this is counteracted by a small sample size (N=68), which makes the finding less stable and potentially an overestimate of the true effect. Moreover, the study uses a complex paradigm (Bayesian modeling) and a highly specialized statistical analysis (contrast of correlated correlations), both of which are difficult to reproduce exactly and can be sensitive to small, unstated procedural variations.
---
0.68
This study has a strong chance of replicating due to the robust statistical evidence (z=3.10, which corresponds to a p‑value of approximately .002). However, this optimism is tempered by the modest sample size (N=68), which can lead to overestimated effect sizes. Furthermore, the high analytical complexity, involving a Bayesian model and a test of correlated correlations, increases the risk that the finding is sensitive to specific methodological choices that are difficult to reproduce exactly.
---
0.45
While the reported test statistic is strong (z=3.10 corresponds to p≈.002), which is a positive indicator, this is offset by several risk factors. The sample size of 68 is small for a study involving correlations and modeling, increasing the risk of an overestimated effect. Furthermore, the analysis is highly complex (a test of contrast of correlated correlations) and involves a Bayesian model, introducing analytical flexibility and potential difficulties in achieving an exact replication.
---
0.45
The prediction is moderate-to-low despite a strong test statistic (z = 3.10), which implies a p‑value much smaller than the one reported. This is because the finding's robustness is undermined by the small sample size (N=68) and the use of a complex, non-standard analysis involving a computational model. These factors, combined with the absence of a reported effect size, suggest the result may be less stable than the test statistic alone would imply.
---
0.65
A strong test statistic (z=3.10, indicating p < .002) is the primary factor supporting a successful replication, as low p‑values are the best predictor of replicability. However, this is tempered by a small sample size (N=68) and a highly complex, non-standard analysis involving correlated correlations. These factors, along with the social psychology subfield, increase the risk that the original finding is a fragile or overestimated effect that may not be found in a new sample."

Furthermore, the effect relies on a complex social manipulation, and such findings can be sensitive to subtle contextual differences between labs, making successful replication more challenging.

The very large effect size (ηp² = 0.241) and strong p‑value (<.01) suggest a robust finding that is likely to replicate. However, this conclusion is tempered by the small sample size (N=67), which increases the risk that the reported effect is an overestimate of the true effect. While the statistical evidence is strong, the study's low power and social-psychology context introduce considerable uncertainty.

0.62
The study reports a very strong effect (ηp² = 0.241) with a low p-value, which are positive indicators for replication. However, the small sample size (N=67) is a major concern, as results from such studies often have inflated effect sizes and may not be stable. While the simple ANOVA is a plus, the finding is in social psychology, a subfield with a history of mixed replication results, leading to a moderately positive but cautious prediction.
---
0.68
The reported p-value is very low (<.01) and the effect size is large (ηp^2 = 0.241), both of which are strong positive predictors for replication. However, the small sample size (N=67) is a significant weakness, as it increases the chance of a spurious result and suggests the true effect size is likely smaller than what was reported. The straightforward analysis and experienced author are favorable, but the risk posed by the small sample tempers the otherwise strong statistical evidence.

The reported p-value is strong (p<.01) and the effect size is medium-to-large (ΔR²=.09), both of which favor successful replication. While the sample size (N=70) is small for a regression analysis and could indicate an overestimated effect, the abstract states that this finding is based on a series of four studies, which suggests a degree of internal replication and robustness. The combination of a strong signal and this programmatic research approach makes replication likely, though the effect size may be smaller in a replication with a larger sample.

0.78
The prediction is moderately high due to several converging factors. The reported p-value is reasonably strong (p<.01), and the finding—that more structurally similar tests yield higher correlations—is theoretically plausible and was demonstrated across four separate studies in the original paper. While the sample size of 70 is small for a regression analysis and poses a risk, the strong internal evidence and the methodological (rather than counter-intuitive) nature of the claim increase the likelihood of a successful replication.
---
0.82
The prediction is high due to a strong p‑value (p<.01) and, most importantly, the presence of four studies in the paper, which constitutes a robust internal replication. Although the sample size of 70 is somewhat small for a regression analysis and could lead to an overestimated effect size, the consistency across studies and strong statistical evidence suggest the underlying effect is real and likely to replicate successfully. The finding is also a plausible methodological refinement rather than a counterintuitive behavioral effect, further increasing confidence.
---
0.65
Although the small sample size (N=70) and a p-value just under .01 are risk factors, the study’s central claim is supported by a series of four experiments. This internal replication by an experienced author suggests the effect is robust, despite the potential that the reported effect size from any single study is inflated. Therefore, the likelihood of replication is moderately high.
---
0.65
The prediction is moderately high because this is a multi-study paper with a theory-driven hypothesis and a strong p-value (p < .01), suggesting a robust finding. However, confidence is tempered by the small sample size (N=70) for the reported hierarchical regression, which could lead to an overestimated effect size. While the social psychology subfield has a mixed replication history, the internal replication across four studies and the experienced author are positive indicators."

This prediction is very high primarily due to the massive sample size (N > 230,000), which provides extremely stable estimates that are not likely due to random chance. The reported F-statistic is also exceptionally large, indicating a strong signal that should easily be found again in a replication. Although the analysis is a simple Levene's test, the sheer scale of the data makes the finding of differential variance across age groups a highly robust and replicable result.

The prediction is very high due to the massive sample size (N > 230,000), which all but eliminates the risk of sampling error. This statistical power, combined with the extremely small p-value and large F-statistic, provides powerful evidence for a real effect that would almost certainly be detected again in an independent replication. Although the specific effect size is not given, the sheer strength of the statistical evidence makes the finding highly robust and likely to replicate successfully.
---
0.85
The extremely large sample size (N > 230,000) provides very high statistical power, and the large F-statistic suggests a robust and substantial effect, not merely a statistically significant one. Although the overall analysis described in the abstract is complex, this specific core finding of differing variability across age groups is very likely to replicate due to the stability afforded by the enormous dataset. The finding itself—that personality structure changes with age—is also consistent with established theories, increasing confidence in its replicability.

0.9
This study’s likelihood of replication is very high primarily due to its massive sample size, which ensures highly stable and precise estimates of the reported effects. The extremely large F‑statistic also indicates a substantial, non‑trivial effect, not merely a finding that is significant due to statistical power. While the specific patterns of results are complex, the study's focus on broad developmental trends in a large‑scale descriptive design makes the core findings likely to be robust.
---
0.85
The prediction is high due to the exceptionally large sample size (N > 230,000), which provides a very precise estimate of the effect, and the highly significant test statistic. Although the corresponding effect size is likely small, the finding describes a plausible developmental pattern that is not counter-intuitive. A well-powered replication is therefore very likely to detect a statistically significant effect in the same direction."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
Six studies examined the role of young adults' parental attachment in terror management. Studies 1-3 revealed that activating thoughts of one's parent in response to mortality salience (MS) reduced death-thought accessibility and worldview defense and increased feelings of self-worth. Studies 4-5 demonstrated that MS led to greater ease of recalling positive maternal interactions and greater difficulty recalling negative interactions, and increased attraction to a stranger who was described as being similar to one's parent. If reliance on parents for terror management purposes reflects the operation of attachment mechanisms, then such effects should vary on the basis of an individual's attachment style. Study 6 demonstrated that, after MS, insecure individuals were more likely to rely on relationships with their parents, whereas secure individuals were more likely to rely on relationships with romantic partners.

Note:
Some subfields—such as social or developmental psychology—have historically shown lower replication rates compared to others like clinical or personality psychology, though individual study quality still matters.",0.25,0.3,0.45,0.2,0.35,0.31,"0.25
The reported p-value of 0.03 is just below the conventional significance threshold, a range which has been shown to have lower replication rates. The most critical issue is the major inconsistency between the reported test statistic (t=-2.22) and the effect size (pr^2=0.224), which undermines confidence in the reported results. The study’s use of a mortality salience manipulation, a paradigm known to be sensitive to context, further reduces the likelihood of successful replication.
---
0.30
The reported p-value of 0.03 is very close to the .05 significance threshold, a range that is often associated with lower replication rates. More critically, there is a large, mathematically impossible discrepancy between the reported test statistic (t(92)=-2.22) and the very large effect size (pr^2=0.224), which severely undermines the credibility of the finding. While the sample size is moderate, this major statistical inconsistency suggests a high likelihood that the original result is not robust.
---
0.45
The reported p-value of 0.03 is just under the conventional 0.05 threshold, and such marginal results have a lower probability of replicating. While the simple t-test analysis is a positive sign, the sample size of 100 provides only moderate statistical power to reliably detect the observed small-to-medium effect size. The social psychology subfield and topic area have also historically faced challenges with replicability.
---
0.20
The prediction is low due to several major risk factors. The reported p-value of 0.03 is just below the significance threshold, a range known for lower replication rates, and there is a large inconsistency between the t-statistic and the reported effect size, which undermines confidence. While the sample size is moderate, these concerns, along with the study's basis in social priming—a research area with a history of replication difficulties—suggest a low probability of successful replication.
---
0.35
The reported p-value of 0.03 is just below the conventional significance threshold, a range often associated with lower replicability. Furthermore, the modest sample size of 100 provides low statistical power to reliably detect the observed small-to-medium effect, and the study's subfield (social psychology) has historically shown mixed replication results for these types of paradigms."

This study has a very low probability of replication due to a combination of high-risk factors. The small sample size (N=36) and a p-value of .02, which is close to the significance threshold, suggest the original finding may be a false positive with a highly inflated effect size. Additionally, the subfield of social priming is known for having a poor track record of replicability.
---
0.25
The low prediction is driven by a combination of a small sample size (N=36) and a p-value (p=0.02) that is just below the standard significance threshold, suggesting the finding may be fragile. While the reported effect size is large, such estimates are often inflated in underpowered studies. Furthermore, the study's topic of subtle behavioral priming falls into a research area that has a well-documented history of replication failures.

The probability of successful replication is low due to the very small sample size and a p-value that is close to the significance threshold, a combination that often leads to fragile findings. This study's topic, social priming, is part of a subfield with a well-documented history of replication failures. The large reported effect size is therefore likely an overestimation of the true effect and would probably not be found in a new, high-powered study.
---
0.15
The likelihood of successful replication is low due to multiple risk factors. The study combines a very small sample size with a p-value just under the 0.05 threshold, a combination that often fails to replicate. Moreover, the subfield of social priming is known for its low replication rates, and the large effect size reported here is likely inflated due to the small sample and would probably not be found in a larger, more robust study.
---
0.21
The prediction is low due to several combined risk factors. The small sample size (N=36) offers low statistical power and suggests the large effect size may be an overestimate, while the p-value (0.02) is close to the threshold for significance. Furthermore, the study's focus on abstract social priming is a research area that has historically proven difficult to replicate successfully."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
General action and inaction goals can influence the amount of motor or cognitive output irrespective of the type of behavior in question, with the same stimuli producing trivial and important motor and cognitive manifestations normally viewed as parts of different systems. A series of experiments examined the effects of instilling general action and inaction goals using word primes, such as ""action"" and ""rest."" The first 5 experiments showed that the same stimuli influenced motor output, such as doodling on a piece of paper and eating, as well as cognitive output, such as recall and problem solving. The last 2 experiments supported the prediction that these diverse effects can result from the instigation of general action and inaction goals. Specifically, these last 2 studies confirmed that participants were motivated to achieve active or inactive states and that attaining them decreased the effects of the primes on behavior

The study's focus on broad behavioral changes from subtle word priming places it in the subfield of social priming, which has a well-documented history of low replication rates. The reported p-value of 0.02 is statistically significant but is close enough to the 0.05 threshold to warrant caution, as findings in this range are often less robust. While the sample size is moderate, it may be insufficient to reliably detect such a subtle effect, suggesting the reported medium effect size could be an overestimation.
---
0.25
The prediction is low due to the study's topic of broad social priming, a research area with a well‑documented history of replication failures. Furthermore, the p‑value of 0.02 is close to the significance threshold, suggesting the evidence is not overwhelmingly strong, and the reported medium effect size for a subtle manipulation is likely an overestimation. While the sample size is moderate, it may be underpowered to detect a potentially much smaller true effect.
---
0.25
This prediction is low due to a convergence of risk factors. The reported p-value of 0.02 is worryingly close to the .05 threshold, and such “just-significant” results have a lower probability of successful replication. Additionally, the study's topic of broad behavioral effects from conceptual primes (social priming) comes from a subfield that has faced significant replication challenges. While the sample size is decent, the borderline statistical significance and the historically fragile nature of the research area suggest a low likelihood of a successful replication.
---
0.25
The prediction is low because the p-value of 0.02 is close to the significance threshold, a range known for lower replication rates. Furthermore, the study investigates broad social priming, a research area that has historically struggled with replicability. The modest sample size for a between-subjects design also raises the possibility that the reported medium effect size is an overestimation.
---
0.25
The prediction is low primarily because this is a social priming study, a paradigm that has historically replicated poorly. Furthermore, the reported p-value of 0.02 is close to the significance threshold, a factor strongly associated with lower replication rates. While the sample size and effect size are moderate, the fragility suggested by the p-value and the general skepticism surrounding this type of effect make a successful replication unlikely."

This prediction is moderately high primarily because the abstract reports the effect was found across five studies, which is a strong form of internal replication. However, confidence is tempered because the key study's p-value (<.02) is not far from the threshold for significance and the effect size (partial η² ≈ .04) is small. Small effects with p-values in this range can be difficult to replicate, especially for priming-style effects in social-cognitive psychology.
---
0.35
The reported p-value of <.02 is statistically significant but falls in a range that has shown lower rates of replication compared to more extreme p-values. Additionally, the small effect size (assuming partial η² = .04, as η² cannot be negative) suggests the effect is not very strong, making it more difficult to detect reliably in a new sample. While the sample size is adequate, findings in social psychology involving subtle priming effects have also historically faced replication challenges.
---
0.65
The primary factor supporting replicability is the reporting of five studies with consistent findings, which suggests the effect is robust across different operationalizations. The sample size (N=133) is adequate for a lab experiment, but the reported p-value (<.02) is not highly convincing and the effect size is small (ηp² ≈ .04). While the statistical evidence from any single study is modest, the internal replication series makes a successful independent replication moderately likely.
---
0.35
The primary concerns are the small effect size (ηp² ≈ .04) and a p-value (p < .02) that is significant but not highly compelling, suggesting the result may not be robust. While the sample size is adequate, findings in this subfield (social/cognitive priming) have historically shown low replication rates. These factors combined suggest a high likelihood that the observed effect was an overestimate and would not be detected in a direct replication attempt.
---
0.40
The reported p-value of <.02, while statistically significant, is not highly compelling and falls in a range that has a higher risk of being a false positive. This concern is heightened by the small effect size (calculated partial η² ≈ .04), as smaller effects are inherently less robust and require larger samples to replicate reliably. Although the sample size (N=133) is reasonable, the study’s subfield (social/cognitive priming) has a history of mixed replication success for these types of subtle manipulations."

The prediction is low due to the combination of a small sample size (N≈33 for the key test) and a p-value (p=0.03) that is just below the conventional significance threshold. Such statistically marginal results from small samples are often not robust and have a lower probability of replicating. The reported large effect size is also likely to be an overestimation that would shrink in a higher-powered replication attempt.
---
0.28
This prediction is low due to several statistical red flags, primarily the small sample size and the marginal p‑value. With degrees of freedom suggesting N≈33 for the key analysis, the study is likely underpowered, meaning the reported p‑value of 0.03 could be a false positive or the large effect size (ηp² = .16) could be an overestimation. The study's location at the intersection of social and cognitive psychology, using complex ERP methods, further adds to the uncertainty of a successful replication."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
The action-based model of dissonance predicts that following decisional commitment, approach-oriented motivational processes occur to assist in translating the decision into effective and unconflicted behavior. Therefore, the modulation of these approach-oriented processes should affect the degree to which individuals change their attitudes to be more consistent with the decisional commitment (spreading of alternatives). Experiment 1 demonstrated that a neurofeedback-induced decrease in relative left frontal cortical activation, which has been implicated in approach motivational processes, caused a reduction in spreading of alternatives. Experiment 2 manipulated an action-oriented mindset following a decision and demonstrated that the action-oriented mindset caused increased activation in the left frontal cortical region as well as increased spreading of alternatives. Discussion focuses on how this integration of neuroscience and dissonance theory benefits both parent literatures.

Some subfields—such as social or developmental psychology—have historically shown lower replication rates compared to others like clinical or personality psychology, though individual study quality still matters.",0.35,0.42,0.28,0.38,0.35,0.356,"0.35
The primary factor lowering the replication probability is the reported p-value of <.05, which corresponds to an F-statistic that is barely statistically significant (p ≈ .049). Such ""just-significant"" findings are often associated with inflated effect sizes and have a lower probability of replicating successfully due to normal sampling variation. Furthermore, the study's use of complex methods like neurofeedback and EEG analysis can introduce technical challenges that make a successful direct replication more difficult.
---
0.42
This prediction is low primarily because the key p-value is just below the .05 significance threshold, a factor strongly associated with lower replication rates. While the reported effect size is medium-to-large and the sample size is adequate for a repeated-measures design, this effect is likely an overestimation given the marginal p-value. Additionally, the technical complexity of the neurofeedback manipulation may pose a significant challenge for another lab to replicate successfully.
---
0.28
The prediction is low primarily because the reported test statistic yields a p-value (p ≈ .049) that is just barely below the .05 significance threshold, a strong predictor of replication failure. Furthermore, the study's methodological complexity, integrating specialized neurofeedback techniques with a social psychology paradigm, increases the difficulty of conducting a faithful replication. While the sample size is moderate and the effect size is reasonably large, these positive factors are often insufficient to overcome the statistical fragility indicated by a borderline p-value.
---
0.38
The prediction is low primarily because the reported p-value is just under the .05 threshold, indicating the result is not statistically robust. This weakness is compounded by the modest sample size for a three-group design, which increases the likelihood that the reported medium-to-large effect size is an overestimation. While the first author’s very high citation count suggests methodological expertise, the statistical fragility and the technical complexity of the neurofeedback manipulation present significant challenges for a successful replication.
---
0.35
The primary reason for this lower estimate is the reported p-value of <.05, which corresponds to an exact p-value of approximately 0.049 calculated from the F-statistic. Results this close to the significance threshold are statistically fragile and have a lower probability of successfully replicating. While the reported effect size is medium-to-large, the borderline p-value, combined with the complex neurofeedback manipulation and the study's basis in social psychology, suggests a higher risk of replication failure."

Suggesting that these prototypes are applied to personal relationships when vulnerabilities are expressed, those who claimed to have expressed vulnerabilities doubted the partner's authenticity because they believed that they were viewed as vulnerable (Studies 2A, 2B, and 4). Authenticity doubts in turn predicted perceptions of rejection (Studies 3 and 4), which in turn predicted partner derogation and subsequent expressions of vulnerability (Study 4). An experimental manipulation of reflected appraisals of vulnerability increased doubts about the authenticity of a new acquaintance's expressions of emotion (Study 5).

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
The authors present a model positing that when people are insecure about a relationship partner's acceptance, they often express emotional vulnerabilities to the partner, which causes them to believe the partner views them as highly vulnerable and insecure. In turn, this belief causes them to doubt the authenticity of the partner's expressions of positive regard, which may perpetuate the experience and expression of insecurity that initiated the process. Prototypes of interactions with interpersonally vulnerable individuals included partners' inauthentic expressions of regard (Study 1). Suggesting that these prototypes are applied to personal relationships when vulnerabilities are expressed, those who claimed to have expressed vulnerabilities doubted the partner's authenticity because they believed that they were viewed as vulnerable (Studies 2A, 2B, and 4). Authenticity doubts in turn predicted perceptions of rejection (Studies 3 and 4), which in turn predicted partner derogation and subsequent expressions of vulnerability (Study 4). An experimental manipulation of reflected appraisals of vulnerability increased doubts about the authenticity of a new acquaintance's expressions of emotion (Study 5). Relational insecurity may be perpetuated via the intrapersonal cognitive consequences of expressing it.

Some subfields—such as social or developmental psychology—have historically shown lower replication rates compared to others like clinical or personality psychology, though individual study quality still matters.",0.35,0.35,0.35,0.35,0.42,0.364,"0.35
The reported p-value is close to the conventional .05 threshold and the corresponding effect size (ηp² = 0.028) is small, both of which are strong predictors of lower replicability. While the sample size of 186 is not exceptionally small, it may be insufficient to reliably detect such a modest effect. The complexity of the multi-study mediation model also introduces more potential points of failure for a direct replication.
---
0.35
The prediction is low due to the combination of a small effect size (ηp² = 0.028) and a p‑value reported as just under the .05 threshold. Such marginally significant results for small effects are often difficult to replicate, as the original finding may be a statistical artifact or an overestimation of the true effect. While the sample size of 186 is not small, it may not be large enough to provide sufficient power for a robust replication attempt of this subtle effect.
---
0.35
The primary drivers for this low prediction are the combination of a small effect size (ηp^2 = 0.028) and a p-value just under the .05 significance threshold. Such findings are statistically less robust and have a lower probability of successful replication, as the original study may have been underpowered to detect such a subtle effect reliably. While the sample size is moderate, it may be insufficient for a stable estimate, a common issue in social psychology research concerning nuanced interpersonal dynamics.
---
0.35
This study has a low probability of replication due to the combination of a small effect size (ηp² = 0.028) and a p-value reported as just below the conventional significance threshold of .05. The sample size of 186 is relatively modest and likely underpowered to reliably detect such a small effect, increasing the chance that the original finding was a false positive or that the effect size is inflated. While the author is well-established, these statistical markers are strong predictors of replication difficulty.
---
0.42
This prediction is primarily driven by the small reported effect size (ηp² = 0.028) and a p-value that is significant but not strong (p<.05), factors that suggest the original result may be inflated and hard to reproduce. Although the sample size (N=186) is adequate, the study's subfield of social psychology and the complexity of the multi-step model pose challenges to robust replication. The combination of a small effect in a field with historically lower replication rates makes a successful replication less than likely."

The prediction is very high due to an extremely significant p-value (<.001) and a very large reported effect size (R² = .68), both of which are strong indicators of replicability. Furthermore, the abstract describes a series of five studies using diverse methodologies (experimental and longitudinal), suggesting the effect has already been internally replicated and is robust. These factors strongly suggest a successful replication, despite the analysis being a moderately complex multilevel model.

The prediction for high replicability is primarily driven by the extremely strong reported effect size (R² = .68) and the highly significant p-value (<.001) from a respectable sample size. Furthermore, the abstract describes a robust research program with five studies using both experimental and longitudinal methods, which greatly increases confidence that the finding is not a statistical artifact of a single design. The convergence of evidence for this psychologically plausible effect suggests a direct replication is very likely to succeed.

This study has a high probability of replication due to its extremely strong statistical evidence, including a very low p-value (<.001) and a very large effect size (R2=.68). The finding is also supported by a robust research program, with the effect being demonstrated across five different studies using both experimental and longitudinal methods. While the complex multilevel model analysis could present a challenge for exact replication, the sheer magnitude of the reported effect suggests it should be readily detectable.

The prediction for high replication success is driven by the combination of a very low p-value (<.001) and an exceptionally large effect size (R² = .68). An effect of this magnitude is highly powered with the given sample size (N=153) and is very likely to be detected in a new study. The fact that the original paper reported a series of five studies demonstrating the effect provides additional evidence of its robustness.

0.88
The prediction is high due to the exceptionally strong evidence, including a very low p-value (<.001) and a massive effect size (R² = .68). While the multilevel analysis is complex and the subfield of social psychology has faced replication challenges, an effect of this magnitude with a sample of 153 is very likely to be robust and replicate successfully. The presence of five studies with converging evidence in the original paper further bolsters this confidence."

This prediction balances positive and negative indicators. On the positive side, the study reports a moderate effect size (d = .45) and uses a simple, standard analysis (t-test) for a straightforward experimental manipulation. However, the reported p-value is just under the .05 threshold (the exact p ≈ .02), and such results have historically shown lower replication rates, often because the original effect size was overestimated. The moderate sample size of 110 provides less-than-ideal statistical power, increasing the risk that a direct replication might fail to find a significant effect.

This prediction is based on several moderately positive indicators. The sample size (N=110) and effect size (d=.45) are reasonable for a lab study, and the analysis is a simple t‑test. The reported p‑value (<.05) corresponds to an actual p‑value of approximately .02, which provides some cushion against the .05 threshold but is not exceptionally strong. While these factors suggest a better-than-even chance of replication, the original study was only modestly powered (approx. 66%) to detect this effect, which increases the risk that the finding was a false positive or the effect size is overestimated.

This prediction balances positive and negative indicators for replicability. On one hand, the use of a simple t‑test reduces analytical flexibility, and the inclusion of two studies with converging evidence strengthens the theoretical claim. On the other hand, the sample size of 110 offers only modest statistical power for the reported small‑to‑medium effect size (d = .45), increasing the risk that the original result was an overestimate and would be difficult to reproduce.

0.58
While the study benefits from a simple design (independent t-test) and a plausible theoretical framework, the reported p-value is just under the .05 threshold (p≈.021). Such findings, combined with a moderate sample size (N=110) and effect size (d=.45), have a notable risk of being overestimated and thus a lower probability of successful replication. The straightforward experimental manipulation and experienced author provide some counterbalance to these statistical concerns.

0.45
The prediction is moderate due to competing factors. While the analysis is a simple t‑test, which is a strong positive sign, the reported p‑value is just under the .05 threshold (recalculated as p≈.02), a known risk factor for non‑replication. The small‑to‑medium effect size and sample size suggest the study was somewhat underpowered, and social psychology studies can be sensitive to subtle contextual factors not captured in a replication."

The reported p-value of <.02, while statistically significant, is close to the conventional .05 threshold, a factor associated with lower replication rates. While the medium effect size (d=.56) and reasonable sample size (N=71) are positive signs, the study's high methodological complexity—involving the calculation of 1/f noise from reaction time data—introduces potential for unstated procedural moderators that could make a direct replication difficult. These factors, combining a borderline p-value with a novel and complex paradigm, suggest a below-average probability of success.
---
0.45
The reported medium effect size (d=.56) is promising, but this is tempered by a p-value (p<.02) that is statistically significant but not highly compelling. The moderate sample size (N=71) for a between-subjects design means the effect size estimate has considerable uncertainty. Furthermore, the specialized nature of 1/f noise analysis could introduce hidden complexity that challenges direct replication.
---
0.45
The reported p-value (<.02) is close to the significance threshold of .05, and the modest sample size (N=71) has relatively low power to reliably detect the reported medium effect size. This combination of a ""just significant"" p-value and low power is a strong predictor of replication failure. While the specific, planned nature of the analysis is a strength, the novelty of applying a complex cognitive metric (1/f noise) to a social domain introduces additional uncertainty.
---
0.38
The prediction is below 0.5 primarily due to the reported p‑value of <.02, which is statistically significant but not highly robust and falls into a range often associated with lower replication rates. While the reported effect size is medium‑to‑large (d=.56) and the author is experienced, the analysis is highly complex (1/f noise from Fourier analysis), which can hide methodological flexibility or errors that undermine replicability. The moderate sample size (N=71) provides only decent power, suggesting the original finding may be an overestimation of the true effect.
---
0.35
The reported p-value of <.02 is significant but not highly convincing, and the sample size of 71 is low for a between-subjects design, suggesting the original study may have been underpowered and the effect size overestimated. The novelty and complexity of the primary dependent measure (1/f noise derived from Fourier analysis) introduces many potential researcher degrees of freedom, making a successful replication less certain. The subfield of social psychology has also demonstrated lower replication rates for these types of effects."

The reported p-value is extremely low and the effect size is very large, which are strong predictors of replicability.

Furthermore, findings from social psychology that rely on inducing a cognitive state that carries over to a subsequent judgment task have historically shown mixed replication success, creating significant risk.

This study has a high likelihood of replication due to the overwhelmingly strong evidence reported, including an extremely small p-value (<.0001) and a very large effect size (ηp² = .362). The finding is further bolstered by being demonstrated across five experiments and originating from a highly-cited author. The main point of caution is the relatively small sample size, which can produce inflated effect size estimates, but the sheer magnitude of the reported effect suggests a genuine and robust phenomenon.

This study has a very high probability of replication. The reported p-value is extremely low (<.0001) and the effect size is exceptionally large (ηp² = .362), which are two of the strongest predictors of replicability. While the sample size is modest, it provides overwhelming statistical power for an effect of this magnitude, and the use of a standard ANOVA reduces concerns about analytical flexibility.
---
0.85
The extremely low p-value (p<.0001) and very large effect size (ηp²=.362) provide strong evidence for the reported effect, suggesting a high likelihood of replication success. Although the modest sample size may have led to an inflated effect size estimate, the statistical evidence is so compelling that a significant result is probable even if the true effect is smaller. The high citation count of the first author provides some additional confidence, though the subfield can be prone to replication difficulties.
---
0.85
The prediction for high replicability is primarily driven by the extremely strong statistical evidence: a very low p-value (<.0001) and a very large effect size (ηp^2 = .362). Such a robust reported effect is highly likely to be detected again, even if its magnitude is slightly smaller in a replication. While social psychology studies have historically shown lower replication rates, the strength of these specific results and the relatively large sample size outweigh general subfield concerns."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
People are more forgiving toward transgressors if they see themselves as capable of committing similar offenses, as demonstrated in 7 studies. Methods included hypothetical scenarios, actual recalled offenses, individual and group processes, and correlational and experimental designs. Three factors mediated the link between personal capability and forgiveness: seeing the other's offense as less severe, greater empathic understanding, and perceiving oneself as similar to the transgressor. In terms of predicting forgiveness, it was important that people's own offenses were similar to the target offense in terms of both severity and type. The personal capability effect was independent of other established predictors of forgiveness and was more pronounced among men than women.

The prediction is moderately high because the reported statistics show a strong signal: the p-value is low (<.01) and the effect size is large (ηp² = .186). However, the small sample size (N=45) is a significant concern, as such studies can produce unstable estimates and inflated effect sizes. Still, the strength of the original finding provides a substantial buffer, making a successful replication plausible even if the true effect is smaller than reported.

0.78
The abstract describes a robust program of 7 studies, which strongly suggests the effect has been internally replicated and is not a fluke. While the specific key metrics reported are from a small sample (N=45), which carries a risk of an inflated effect size, the strong p-value (<.01) and the established author provide additional confidence. The primary driver for the high replication estimate is the existence of a multi-study investigation, making it likely that an independent replication would also succeed.
---
0.75
The reported p-value is strong (<.01) and the effect size is large (ηp² = .186), which both suggest a robust finding. While the small sample size (N=45) is a significant concern that risks effect size inflation, this risk is mitigated because the finding is one of a series of seven studies demonstrating the same effect. This internal replication within the paper substantially increases confidence that the result is not a statistical artifact and would be successfully replicated.
---
0.60
The very small sample size (N=45) is a major concern and suggests the large reported effect size (ηp²=.186) is likely inflated. However, this is counteracted by the strong p-value (<.01) and, most importantly, the fact that this is one of seven studies in the paper demonstrating the same core finding. This internal replication series suggests the underlying effect is robust, increasing the likelihood of successful independent replication.
---
0.65
The small sample size (N=45) is a significant concern, as it can lead to inflated effect size estimates and less stable results, a known issue in social psychology. However, this is strongly counterbalanced by the fact that the paper presents a series of 7 studies with diverse methods, and the specific result shows a strong signal (p<.01). Therefore, a well-powered replication is likely to find a significant, albeit potentially smaller, effect."

The prediction is low primarily because the reported p-value is based on a test statistic (F(1, 116) = 4.15) that is just barely significant (p ≈ .044). This statistical fragility, combined with a small effect size (ηp² = 0.035) and a moderate sample size, indicates the original study had low power to detect the effect. Consequently, a direct replication has a high chance of producing a non-significant result due to random sampling variation alone.
---
0.35
This prediction is low primarily due to the combination of a p‑value just below the .05 significance threshold and a small reported effect size (ηp² = 0.035). Such statistically fragile results have a lower historical rate of successful replication, as the original finding may be an overestimation of the true effect. While the sample of 122 is not tiny, it may lack sufficient statistical power to reliably detect this small effect in a new study.
---
0.25
The key predictors of low replicability here are the weak statistical evidence. The reported p‑value is just below the conventional .05 threshold, and studies with such marginal significance have a substantially lower probability of replicating successfully. This concern is compounded by the small effect size (ηp² = 0.035), which suggests the original study was underpowered and that a replication with a similar sample would have a low chance of detecting the effect.
---
0.35
This prediction is low primarily due to the combination of a p-value just under the .05 significance threshold and a small reported effect size (ηp² = 0.035). Studies with p-values this close to the cutoff are statistically less robust and have a lower chance of replicating, as minor sampling variations can easily push the result into non-significance. The moderate sample size of 122 provides limited statistical power to reliably detect such a small effect, a known challenge in social cognition research.
---
0.35
The primary predictors of a low replication probability are the marginal p-value and the small effect size. An F-statistic of 4.15 yields a p-value of approximately .044, which is very close to the .05 threshold and suggests low statistical power. The small effect size (ηp² = 0.035) further indicates that the finding may not be robust, a conclusion reinforced by the study's home in social psychology, a subfield with historically mixed replication rates."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
The present research tests whether recognition for the nonverbal expression of pride generalizes across cultures. Study 1 provided the first evidence for cross-cultural recognition of pride, demonstrating that the expression generalizes across Italy and the United States. Study 2 found that the pride expression generalizes beyond Western cultures; individuals from a preliterate, highly isolated tribe in Burkina Faso, West Africa, reliably recognized pride, regardless of whether it was displayed by African or American targets. These Burkinabe participants were unlikely to have learned the pride expression through cross-cultural transmission, so their recognition suggests that pride may be a human universal. Studies 3 and 4 used drawn figures to systematically manipulate the ethnicity and gender of targets showing the expression, and demonstrated that pride recognition generalizes across male and female targets of African, Asian, and Caucasian descent. Discussion focuses on the implications of the findings for the universality of the pride expression.

Key details:
- Sample size: 211
- Analysis type (e.g. rm ANOVA, mixed ANOVA, regression, t‑test): binomial test
- Test statistic: X
- Reported p‑value: <.05
- Effect size (e.g. Cohen’s d, r): Av. Proportion = 0.78
- First author’s citation count: 4719
- Subfield: Cognitive, Social

Note:
Some subfields—such as social or developmental psychology—have historically shown lower replication rates compared to others like clinical or personality psychology, though individual study quality still matters.",0.92,0.82,0.85,0.92,0.72,0.846,"0.92
The prediction for high replicability is primarily driven by the very large effect size (average correct recognition of 0.78), which suggests a robust and easily detectable phenomenon. While the sample size is moderate and the p-value is reported imprecisely, the sheer magnitude of the effect makes it highly likely to replicate. Furthermore, the use of a simple analysis (binomial test) and converging evidence from four distinct studies strengthens confidence in the original result.

0.82
The prediction is high due to the very large effect size (average recognition proportion of 0.78), which signals a robust phenomenon that should be easy to detect again. This is supported by a simple analysis (binomial test) and a strong research design involving an isolated preliterate tribe, a classic method for testing universality. While the reported p-value of <.05 is a negative indicator, the sheer magnitude of the effect makes a successful replication highly probable.
---
0.85
This study has a high probability of successful replication. The reported effect size is very large (78% recognition rate), suggesting a strong and easily detectable phenomenon, and the statistical analysis is a simple binomial test with little room for analytical flexibility. Although the reported p-value is only just below the standard significance threshold, the combination of a large effect, straightforward design, and converging evidence from multiple sub-studies makes the core finding appear robust.
---
0.92
This study has a very high probability of replication primarily due to its large effect size (78% recognition rate), which suggests a robust underlying phenomenon. This confidence is bolstered by the use of a simple statistical analysis (binomial test) and a strong cross‑cultural design that effectively tests for universality. The adequate sample size and the author's high citation count are also positive indicators.
---
0.72
This study has a good chance of replicating due to its very large reported effect size (78% proportion correct), which is a strong predictor of success, and its simple, transparent analysis (binomial test). However, the prediction is lowered because the reported p-value is just under the .05 threshold, a known risk factor for non-replication, and the study is in social psychology, a subfield with a mixed replication history."

This study's reported p-value is strong (p=.002), and the sample size (N=261) is adequate for a social psychology experiment, lending confidence to the result. While the effect size is modest (ηp² = .042), the original study was well-powered to detect it, and the use of a standard ANOVA reduces analytical complexity.

0.68
The reported p-value is quite low (p = .002) and the sample size (N=261) is adequate, which are strong positive indicators for replicability. However, the partial eta-squared effect size is in the small-to-medium range (ηp² = .042), and smaller effects can be less robust and harder to detect in new samples. The straightforward ANOVA analysis is a plus, but the modest effect size introduces some uncertainty.

0.65
This prediction is based on a reasonably strong p-value and a decent sample size for a lab experiment. However, the effect size is small-to-medium (ηp² = .042), which tempers confidence as smaller effects are less robust and harder to replicate. The study also proposes a mediation model, which introduces analytical complexity that could further challenge a successful replication of the full theoretical claim.
---
0.81
The prediction is high due to the strong statistical evidence, particularly the very low p‑value (p = .002) and a solid sample size (N = 261), which together suggest a robust finding. While the effect size (ηp^2 = .042) is small-to-medium and the mediational claim is conceptually complex, the primary statistical test is strong enough to expect a successful replication. The standard ANOVA analysis and moderate author experience also support a positive outlook.
---
0.72
This prediction is fairly high due to the strong p-value (0.002) and a solid sample size (261), which imply the original study was well-powered to detect the effect. However, confidence is tempered because the effect size (partial η² = .042) is only small-to-medium, and studies in social psychology have historically shown lower replication rates. Overall, the robust statistical evidence suggests a better-than-average chance of successful replication."

This prediction is low primarily due to the very small sample size and a p-value that barely clears the .05 significance threshold. Results that are ""just significant"" are often statistically fragile and prone to sampling error, making them less likely to replicate successfully. Although the reported effect size is medium, the low statistical power means this estimate is imprecise and could be inflated.

0.42
The reported p-value is just under the conventional .05 threshold, a common signal of a fragile result that may not be robust. This concern is magnified by the very small sample size (N=37), which yields an imprecise effect size estimate and low statistical power. While the existence of three supporting studies in the original paper is a positive sign, the weak evidence in this specific test suggests a low probability of successful replication.

This prediction is low due to the combination of a very small sample size (N=37) and a p‑value that is just barely below the conventional significance threshold of .05. Such ""p‑just‑so"" results are statistically fragile and often fail to replicate, especially when the initial study has low power. While the reported effect size is medium, it is likely an overestimation due to these statistical artifacts.

The probability of successful replication is low due to the very small sample size (N=37) and a p-value that is just barely below the .05 significance threshold. This combination suggests the result is statistically fragile and that the reported medium effect size is likely inflated. While the author's citation count is moderate and the analysis is simple, these factors are outweighed by the weak statistical evidence of the original finding.

0.22
This study's reported finding is highly unlikely to replicate successfully. The primary reasons are the very small sample size (N=37) and a p-value that is just barely below the conventional .05 threshold for significance (a chi-squared value of 3.85 is extremely close to the critical value of 3.84). Such ""p-hacked"" or fragile results are notoriously difficult to replicate, and the reported medium effect size is likely an overestimation."

This prediction is moderately high because the original paper reported four separate studies that conceptually replicate the key interaction, suggesting the finding is robust across different contexts. Although the primary study has a strong p-value and an adequate sample size for its finding, the effect size is small-to-medium (ηp² = 0.041). This smaller effect is the main risk factor, as such findings can be more sensitive to context and require high statistical power to replicate successfully.
---
0.65
The prediction is moderately high due to strong statistical evidence, including a p-value well below .01 and a solid F-statistic on an adequate sample size. However, the effect size is small-to-medium (ηp^2 = 0.041), and the finding is an interaction effect, both of which can be more difficult to replicate than larger, simpler effects. These cautious factors temper the otherwise positive statistical signals.
---
0.45
The prediction is moderately low due to the small-to-medium effect size (ηp²=0.041), which may be an overestimation and thus difficult to detect in a new sample. Furthermore, the finding is a nuanced interaction effect within social psychology, a combination that has historically been challenging to replicate. While the p-value is strong (p<.01) and the sample size is reasonable, these positive factors are tempered by the small magnitude of the effect.
---
0.65
The reported p-value is strong (p < .01) for a reasonably large sample (N=246), and the finding is supported by a series of four studies, which increases confidence. However, the effect size is small-to-medium (ηp² = 0.041), and complex interaction effects can be more fragile and difficult to replicate than simpler main effects. These factors suggest a better-than-even but not certain chance of replication success.
---
0.45
While the study has a respectable sample size and a strong p-value, the reported effect size is small (ηp^2 = 0.041). The finding is also a nuanced interaction within social psychology, a subfield that has historically faced replication challenges. Small effects can be difficult to reliably reproduce, as the original result may have been inflated by chance, making a successful replication uncertain."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
The authors investigated whether an implemental mind-set fosters stronger attitudes. Participants who made a decision about how to act (vs. those who held off) expressed a more extreme attitude toward an issue unrelated to the decision (Experiment 1). Participants who planned the implementation of a decision (vs. deliberated vs. control) exhibited less ambivalent (Experiment 2) and more accessible (Experiment 3) attitudes toward various objects unrelated to the decision. Moreover, an attitude reported by planning participants better predicted self-reported behavior 1 week later (Experiment 4). Finally, results suggest that the effect of an implemental mind-set on attitude strength toward unrelated objects is driven by a focus on information that supports an already-made decision (Experiment 5). Implications for attitudes, goals, and mind-sets are discussed.

The predicted likelihood of replication is low due to the combination of a very small sample size (N=46) and a p-value just below the conventional significance threshold of .05. Such findings are often statistically fragile, and the large reported effect size (ηp² = 0.135) is likely an overestimation due to sampling error, also known as the ""winner's curse."" Studies with these characteristics, particularly in social psychology, have historically shown low rates of successful replication.

The likelihood of successful replication is low due to the combination of a very small sample size (N=46) and a p-value just under the significance threshold. Such studies have low statistical power, and the large reported effect size (ηp² = 0.135) is likely an overestimation. The finding itself, a subtle mindset effect on an unrelated attitude, is characteristic of a research area in social psychology that has historically shown low replicability.

0.25
Confidence in replication is low primarily due to the very small sample size (N=46 for a three-group design) and a p-value that is just below the .05 significance threshold. This combination suggests the study had low statistical power, which increases the risk of a false positive and means the large reported effect size is likely inflated. The subfield of social psychology has also faced challenges replicating subtle ""mind-set"" effects, further lowering the probability of success.

0.28
The prediction is low primarily due to the very small sample size (N=46) and a p-value that is just below the .05 significance threshold. While the reported effect size is large (ηp² = 0.135), such estimates are often inflated in underpowered studies and are less credible. The combination of a small sample and a fragile p-value suggests the original finding has a high probability of being a false positive and is therefore unlikely to replicate successfully.
---
0.20
The prediction is low due to a combination of high-risk factors. The small sample size (N=46) provides low statistical power, and the reported p-value (<.05) corresponding to the F-statistic is very close to the significance threshold, suggesting the result is fragile. While the effect size is large, it is likely an overestimation given the low power, and subtle mindset manipulations in social psychology have historically proven difficult to replicate."

The probability of replication is moderately high. The reported effect size (ηp² = .07) is medium, and the p-value is stronger than the reported ""<.05"" threshold (the F‑statistic corresponds to p ≈ .01), suggesting a reliable signal. While the sample size of 94 is only moderate, the straightforward between‑subjects ANOVA is less prone to error, and the fact that this is one of four supporting studies in the paper increases confidence in the effect's robustness.

The probability is moderately high. Although the reported p‑value is close to the significance threshold and the sample size is only moderate for a between‑subjects design, the effect size (ηp² = .07) is respectable. The most critical factor boosting confidence is that the paper reports four studies supporting the same theoretically‑driven hypothesis, which serves as a strong form of internal replication.
---
0.72
This study has a good chance of replicating due to a combination of a strong p-value (calculated from the F-statistic to be p≈.01) and a medium effect size (ηp² = .07). The straightforward between-subjects ANOVA is less susceptible to analytical flexibility than more complex models. While the sample size of 94 is not large, it is adequately powered for the observed effect, though some uncertainty remains.
---
0.70
The study’s sample size (N=94) and medium effect size (ηp² = .07) yield moderate statistical power, but the test statistic is solid (p≈.01), suggesting the result is not borderline. The most encouraging factor is that the finding comes from a series of four supporting studies, which indicates the authors demonstrated internal replication and robustness. While social psychology effects can be context-dependent, the consistency reported in the original paper increases the probability of a successful independent replication.
---
0.6
The F-statistic and medium effect size (ηp²=.07) imply a p-value (≈.01) that is substantially lower than the reported p<.05, which is a positive sign for replication. However, the sample size is only moderate for a between-subjects design, and complex social psychology experiments can be sensitive to subtle contextual factors not present in a replication attempt. These competing considerations suggest a better-than-average, but not guaranteed, likelihood of success."

This study has a low predicted probability of replication due to several risk factors. The sample size (N=50) is small for a correlational study, leading to an unstable estimate. Critically, the reported p-value is just under the .05 threshold for a modest effect size (r=.30), a combination highly characteristic of findings that fail to replicate. The use of a partial correlation with a small sample also suggests the result may not be robust.
---
0.35
This prediction is low due to a combination of a small sample size (N=50) and a p‑value reported just below the conventional significance threshold of .05. Such ""just significant"" results from low-powered studies often represent overestimated effect sizes or false positives that are difficult to replicate. The complexity of using a partial correlation with a high number of covariates relative to the sample size further increases the risk of a spurious finding.
---
0.25
The predicted probability is low due to several risk factors. The study has a small sample size (N=50) for a correlational design, and the reported p‑value (<.05) for the effect size (r=.30) is at the cusp of statistical significance. These factors contribute to a highly uncertain effect estimate with a wide confidence interval, suggesting the original finding is fragile and may not be reproducible.
---
0.25
The study's primary weaknesses are its small sample size (N=50) and a p‑value that is borderline significant (p < .05 from r=.30, which is very close to the threshold). Small samples often produce overestimated effect sizes, and results with p‑values just under .05 are notoriously difficult to replicate. While the author is well-cited, the low statistical power and potential for a spurious finding in this complex partial correlation analysis suggest a low probability of replication success.
---
0.25
The reported p-value is just under the .05 threshold for significance, which is a strong negative predictor of replicability. This, combined with the small sample size (N=50) for a correlational study, suggests the original finding had low statistical power and the effect size may be substantially inflated. The analysis also controlled for a relatively large number of variables (7) for such a small sample, increasing the risk that the result is not robust."

The authors propose that different available information quantities moderate these contradictory findings. Four studies confirmed this expectation.

This prediction is moderately optimistic due to the very strong reported evidence, including an extremely low p-value and a very large effect size. However, this confidence is significantly tempered by the very small sample size, which increases the risk that the effect size is inflated and the result is unstable. While the simple analysis (chi-squared test) and multi-study paper are positive signs, the high potential for sampling error in the key finding makes a successful replication plausible but not certain.
---
0.78
The prediction is moderately high due to the very strong statistical evidence, including a very low p‑value (0.001) and a large effect size (d = 1.17). While the small sample size (N=52) is a significant concern and may mean the true effect is smaller than reported, the signal is so strong that it is likely to be detected again in a replication. The finding is also supported by a straightforward analysis and a series of four studies in the original paper, which adds confidence.
---
0.65
The very low p‑value (0.001) and large effect size suggest a robust finding, supported by a simple, transparent Chi‑squared analysis. However, the small sample size (N=52) is a significant concern, as results from small samples can be unstable and effect sizes can be inflated. While the strength of the original signal is a strong positive, the small sample tempers expectations, leading to a moderately high probability of replication.
---
0.62
The study reports a very low p-value (0.001) and the first author is well-established, both of which are positive signs for replicability. However, the small sample size (N=52) is a major concern, as it suggests the extremely large reported effect size may be an overestimation. While the statistical evidence appears strong, this is tempered by the small sample and the fact that the core finding is an interaction effect, which are often less robust than main effects.
---
0.68
The very low p‑value (p=0.001) and large effect size are strong signals that the finding is not a statistical fluke. However, this is counteracted by the very small sample size (N=52), which makes the effect size estimate less precise and potentially inflated. Given that the study is in social psychology and reports a counterintuitive interaction effect—two factors associated with lower replicability—the overall probability is solid but not certain."

This study’s focus on ego depletion, a concept that has famously failed to replicate in large-scale studies, is a major concern. This theoretical weakness is compounded by a p-value of .02, which is close to the significance threshold and suggests a fragile finding, and a modest sample size for a between-subjects design. Combined, these factors indicate a high risk that the original result was a false positive or that the effect is too small to be detected reliably.
---
0.15
This study has a very low probability of replication for several reasons. The central theoretical construct, ego depletion, is a well-known area in social psychology that has suffered from a major replication crisis, with many large-scale studies failing to find an effect. Furthermore, the reported p-value of .02 is close to the significance threshold of .05, and such marginally significant results are often less robust, while the sample size of 85 is small for a between-subjects design, which can lead to unstable and overestimated effects.
---
0.25
This prediction is low because the study investigates ego depletion, a concept from social psychology with a well-documented history of failed replications. This primary concern is compounded by a p-value (p=.02) that is close to the significance threshold and a small sample size for a between-subjects design. These factors suggest the study was underpowered and the reported effect size is likely an overestimation, reducing the probability of a successful replication.

0.15
This prediction is very low primarily because the study investigates ego depletion, a subfield with a well-documented history of replication failures. This concern is amplified by the study's modest sample size (N=85) for a between-subjects design and a p-value (p=.02) that is not highly robust. These factors suggest the original finding may be a false positive or that the reported effect size (ηp²=.09) is substantially overestimated.

0.15
This study has a low probability of replication due to several factors. The reported p-value of .02 is close to the conventional .05 threshold, and the sample size is relatively small for a between-subjects design, both of which are strong predictors of replication failure. Most importantly, the study's core concept of ego depletion is a notoriously controversial finding from social psychology that has performed very poorly in large-scale, pre-registered replication attempts."

In Study 2, it was demonstrated that Whites' interracial distancing behavior was not predicted by explicit or implicit prejudice. Study 3 provides evidence that conceiving of interracial interactions as opportunities to learn may attenuate the negative consequences of threat for Whites. Study 4 found that Whites have conscious access to their experience of stereotype threat and that this awareness may mediate the relationship between threat and distance. These results are discussed within a broader discourse of racial distancing and the possibility that certain identity threats may be as important as prejudice in determining the outcomes of interracial interactions.

Four studies investigate the role that stereotype threat plays in producing racial distancing behavior in an anticipated conversation paradigm.

Some subfields—such as social or developmental psychology—have historically shown lower replication rates compared to others like clinical or personality psychology, though individual study quality still matters.",0.65,0.35,0.45,0.35,0.35,0.43,"0.65
The study reports a strong signal with a p-value well below the conventional threshold and a large effect size, both of which favor successful replication. However, the small sample size of 55 participants is a significant weakness, as it can lead to unstable results and inflated effect sizes. While the reported effect is strong enough that it would likely still be present in a replication, its magnitude might be smaller, making this a moderately likely but not certain success.
---
0.35
The prediction is low primarily due to the small sample size (N=55) for a between‑subjects design, which suggests the study was underpowered. Although the reported p‑value is strong (<.01) and the effect size is large (ηp²=.16), such results from small samples are often inflated and have a lower probability of replicating. The topic of subtle social interactions can also be sensitive to minor contextual changes, making direct replication more challenging.
---
0.45
While the reported p-value (<.01) and large effect size (ηp² = .16) are strong signals, the small sample size (N=55) is a significant concern. Small samples can produce inflated effect size estimates, meaning the true effect is likely smaller and the result less stable than it appears. Furthermore, findings from social psychology involving subtle experimental manipulations of behavior have historically shown mixed results in replication studies.
---
0.35
The primary concern is the small sample size (N=55), which makes the study statistically underpowered and increases the likelihood that the large observed effect size (ηp² = .16) is an overestimation. Although the p-value is strong (p < .01), such results from small samples are often not robust, and a well-powered replication is likely to find a much smaller or non-significant effect. Furthermore, socially sensitive and context-dependent effects within social psychology can be challenging to reproduce consistently.
---
0.35
While the p-value is strong (<.01) and the reported effect size is large (ηp² = .16), these results are derived from a small sample (N=55), which increases the risk of an overestimated effect or a false positive. Furthermore, the study is in social psychology and investigates stereotype threat, a phenomenon known to be highly sensitive to subtle contextual factors, making it difficult to replicate precisely. These methodological and subfield characteristics suggest a lower probability of successful replication despite the strong initial statistics."

The study's central conclusion is a null effect, supported by a very high p-value (0.48) and a trivial effect size (r=.04) in a moderate sample. Replicating a well-evidenced null finding is often more probable than replicating a marginal positive one, as the evidence for ""no effect"" is quite strong. While the analytical complexity and low degrees of freedom are a concern, they are unlikely to be sufficient to produce a significant effect in a replication attempt.
---
0.92
This study's primary conclusion is a null finding (p = .48), which is strongly supported by a trivial effect size (r = .04). A successful replication would be one that also fails to find a significant sex difference, and the original study's data suggest any true effect is likely nonexistent or extremely small. Therefore, an independent replication is highly likely to reproduce this non-significant result.
---
0.90
The study’s central claim is a null effect (p = .48), which is supported by a very small effect size (r = .04). Such a finding is highly likely to replicate because the evidence strongly suggests the absence of a meaningful effect to begin with, and a replication study with similar statistical power would probably also fail to find one. While the complex multilevel analysis could introduce analytical flexibility, this is less of a concern for a null finding than for a marginally significant one.
---
0.92
The study's central claim is a robust null finding (p = .48), which is supported by a trivial effect size (r = .04). It is generally easier to replicate a null effect than a significant one, especially when the original p-value is far from the significance threshold. A direct replication is therefore highly likely to also fail to find a significant sex difference, thereby confirming the original study's conclusion.

0.85
The study’s central claim is a null finding (p = .48) with a trivial effect size (r = .04), which is highly likely to replicate as non-significant in a new sample. While the analytical approach is very complex and the degrees of freedom are low, introducing some uncertainty, the evidence for the null hypothesis is so strong that it would be surprising if a replication found a meaningful effect. Therefore, a successful replication—defined as also finding a null result—is probable."

One correlational study and 8 experiments manipulating risk, goal strength, and executive strength and then measuring implicit and explicit goal activation and execution strongly supported the model. For people high in self-esteem, risk triggers a control system that directs them toward the situations of dependence within their relationship that can fulfill connectedness goals. For people low in self-esteem, however, the activation of connectedness goals triggers a control system that prioritizes self-protection goals and directs them away from situations where they need to trust or depend on their partner.

Key details:
- Sample size: 91
- Analysis type (e.g. rm ANOVA, mixed ANOVA, regression, t‑test): hierarchical regression analyses
- Test statistic: t(83) = 3.05
- Reported p‑value: <.01
- Effect size (e.g. Cohen’s d, r): sr^2 = .07
- First author’s citation count: 5349
- Subfield: Cognitive, Social

Note:
Some subfields—such as social or developmental psychology—have historically shown lower replication rates compared to others like clinical or personality psychology, though individual study quality still matters.",0.45,0.62,0.35,0.72,0.62,0.552,"0.45
This prediction balances a strong p-value (<.01) against several risk factors for non-replication. The sample size (N=91) is modest for a hierarchical regression, and the corresponding effect size (sr^2=.07) is not large. Complex interaction effects, which are central to the study's model, are known to be less robust and harder to replicate than simple main effects, reducing the likelihood of a successful replication.
---
0.62
The reported p-value (<.01) and associated t-statistic are reasonably strong, and the effect size (sr^2 = .07) is not trivial, suggesting a genuine effect. However, the sample size (N=91) is modest for a complex hierarchical regression analysis. Findings in social psychology, especially those involving interactions and new theoretical models, often require larger samples to replicate robustly.
---
0.35
The prediction is below 0.5 despite a strong reported p‑value (<.01) and a medium effect size, primarily due to the modest sample size (N=91). This sample size may provide insufficient statistical power to reliably detect the complex interaction between a personality trait (self‑esteem) and a situational manipulation. Theoretically complex interaction effects in social psychology often have lower replication rates than simpler main effects, and the hierarchical analysis provides flexibility that can sometimes inflate original findings.
---
0.72
The probability of replication is moderately high, primarily driven by a strong p-value (<.01) and a medium effect size (sr^2 = .07). The sample size of 91 provides good statistical power for this finding, and the first author's high citation count suggests expertise. However, the use of a complex hierarchical regression analysis and a multi-component theoretical model introduces potential challenges for a direct replication, slightly tempering the otherwise positive outlook.
---
0.62
The prediction is moderately high due to a strong p‑value (<.01, from a t‑statistic of 3.05) and a medium effect size (sr^2 = .07), which suggest a statistically robust result. However, this optimism is tempered because the study proposes a complex interaction effect within social psychology, a subfield that has historically faced replication challenges. While the core statistics are promising, the theoretical complexity and field norms introduce considerable uncertainty."

The probability of successful replication is low due to the combination of a very small sample size (N=28) and a test statistic (t=1.87) that produces a p-value just barely below .05 for a one-tailed test, or above .05 for a two-tailed test. Such low-powered studies are prone to unstable results and inflated effect sizes, making the reported large effect (d=.736) likely an overestimation. The study's focus on a subtle social-cognitive phenomenon, a research area with historically mixed replication success, further lowers confidence.
---
0.25
The prediction for a low probability of replication is driven primarily by the very small sample size and a p-value that is just below the conventional .05 threshold. These factors suggest the study was underpowered, increasing the chances of a false positive and an inflated effect size estimate. While the reported effect size is large, findings from small-N studies in social psychology are often difficult to replicate.
---
0.15
The likelihood of replication is very low due to multiple strong red flags. The sample size (N=28) is extremely small, meaning the study was severely underpowered and the large effect size is likely an overestimation. Most importantly, the reported test statistic (t=1.87) is not significant at p<.05 with a standard two-tailed test, suggesting questionable reporting or a fragile, “just-significant” finding that is unlikely to be robust.

0.22
The reported finding is highly unlikely to replicate due to the combination of a very small sample size (N=28) and a p-value that is just below the .05 threshold. The test statistic provided, t(26) = 1.87, only achieves significance with a one-tailed test (p≈.036), while a more standard two-tailed test would be non-significant (p≈.072), suggesting potential p-hacking. Such underpowered studies often produce inflated effect sizes and are prone to being false positives, making them difficult to reproduce.
---
0.15
The likelihood of successful replication is very low due to several critical weaknesses. Most importantly, the reported test statistic (t(26) = 1.87) does not yield a p-value below .05 for a standard two-tailed test (p ≈ .073), which casts severe doubt on the validity of the original finding. Furthermore, the extremely small sample size (N=28) results in low statistical power and suggests the large reported effect size is likely an unstable overestimate."

This prediction is based on the strong statistical evidence; the very low p-value (p=0.001) and large effect size (ηp²=.143) are both powerful predictors of replication success. While the sample size is moderate, it is sufficiently powered to detect an effect of this magnitude. Additionally, the use of three experiments to establish the finding and its mechanism within the original paper suggests the effect is robust and not a statistical artifact.

This prediction is high due to the strong statistical evidence presented. The very low p‑value (0.001) and large effect size (partial η² = .14) are key indicators of a robust finding that is likely to replicate. While the sample size is moderate, it is sufficient to reliably detect an effect of this magnitude, and the use of a standard ANOVA is appropriate. The primary risk is the social nature of the topic, as identity-related effects can sometimes be sensitive to subtle contextual changes in a replication attempt.

The very low p-value (p=0.001) and large effect size (ηp²=.143) are strong indicators of a robust finding that is likely to replicate. Additionally, the moderate sample size is sufficient for detecting a large effect, and the use of a standard ANOVA reduces analytical flexibility that can harm replicability. While the topic is in social psychology, a field with some replication challenges, the strong statistical evidence and straightforward design of this particular study suggest a high likelihood of success.

This study has a high likelihood of replication due to its very low p‑value (p = .001) and large effect size (ηp² = .143), which are strong predictors of success. Although the sample size is only moderate, the strength of the reported statistical evidence suggests the effect is robust and would likely be detected again in a new sample. The experienced first author and the use of a standard ANOVA analysis further increase confidence in the original finding.
---
0.68
While the study reports a very low p-value (0.001) and a large effect size, which are strong predictors of replicability, these results come from a moderate sample size that can risk overestimation. The study's subfield (social psychology) and its reliance on an interaction effect also introduce risk, as these have historically been associated with lower replication rates. Therefore, confidence is tempered despite the strong primary statistical evidence."

The reported p-value of exactly 0.05 is a strong indicator of a fragile, borderline result that is less likely to replicate. This concern is compounded by the small effect size (phi = .13), which implies the original study was underpowered to reliably detect such an effect. Furthermore, subtle experimental manipulations in social-cognitive psychology have historically shown low replication rates.
---
0.25
The primary reason for the low replication estimate is the reported p-value of 0.05, which is exactly on the threshold of statistical significance. Such a result is often fragile, especially when combined with a small effect size (phi = .13) that requires a large, high-powered sample to be detected reliably. While the authors present multiple studies, the finding is in social cognition, a subfield where subtle effects of fluency and priming have historically shown low rates of successful replication.
---
0.15
The primary concern is the p-value of 0.05, which is at the very threshold of significance where replication rates are known to be low; in fact, the reported test statistic (X²=3.83) corresponds to a p-value slightly *above* 0.05. This borderline result, combined with a small effect size (phi = .13), suggests the original study was underpowered and may be a false positive. The simple analysis is a positive sign, but it is heavily outweighed by the statistical weakness of the main finding.
---
0.25
The primary reason for this low prediction is the reported p-value of 0.05, which indicates a finding at the bare minimum threshold for statistical significance and is a strong predictor of replication failure. This weak evidence is paired with a small effect size (phi = .13), which would require a much larger sample than the original 236 to be detected reliably in a new study. While the author is established and the analysis is simple, these factors are insufficient to overcome the statistical fragility of the original result.
---
0.25
The reported p-value of 0.05 is the strongest indicator of low replicability, as results just meeting the significance threshold are often statistically fragile. This concern is compounded by a small effect size (phi = .13), which suggests the original study was underpowered to begin with. Finally, subtle cognitive manipulations within social psychology have historically shown lower replication rates, making a successful independent replication of this finding unlikely."

The study's small sample size (N=36) and a p-value that is close to the .05 significance threshold (an F-statistic of 5.8 corresponds to p ≈ .02) are strong indicators of low replicability. While the reported effect size is large, such estimates are often inflated in small samples, meaning a replication attempt would likely find a smaller effect and may not be sufficiently powered to detect it. The use of a developmental sample (young children) can also introduce variability that makes direct replication more challenging.
---
0.35
The primary concern is the small sample size (N=36), which provides low statistical power and can lead to unstable results. Although the reported effect size is large, such estimates are often inflated in small samples, a phenomenon known as the ""winner's curse."" The p-value being reported as just under the .05 threshold, rather than a more extreme value, further suggests the original finding may not be robust enough to replicate.
---
0.35
This study has a low probability of replication due to its small sample size (N=36) and a p-value that is close to the .05 significance threshold. This combination suggests the study was underpowered, meaning the large reported effect size (d=0.82) is likely an overestimation. While the ANOVA analysis is simple, the weak statistical evidence is a strong indicator of low replicability.
---
0.35
This study's low probability of replication is primarily driven by its small sample size (N=36) and a p-value that, while below .05, is not highly robust. Large effect sizes discovered in small samples are often inflated and tend to shrink upon replication. Furthermore, developmental studies with young children can be sensitive to minor procedural variations, adding another layer of challenge to achieving a successful replication.
---
0.35
This prediction is low primarily due to the small sample size (N=36) and a p-value that is close to the significance threshold (an F-value of 5.8 with these degrees of freedom corresponds to p≈.02). Small samples can produce inflated effect size estimates and are more susceptible to false positives. Furthermore, the study's focus on a specific interaction in young children—a population known for noisy data—adds to the replication challenge."

Specifically, two experiments, using markedly different implicit-learning paradigms, demonstrated facilitation of implicit learning when the goal of achievement was primed. We propose that nonconscious goal pursuit can facilitate not only reproductive operations, but also productive ones, and that implicit learning is sensitive to the organism's nonconscious goals.

Some subfields—such as social or developmental psychology—have historically shown lower replication rates compared to others like clinical or personality psychology, though individual study quality still matters.",0.25,0.32,0.28,0.25,0.2,0.26,"0.25
The reported test statistic corresponds to a p-value of approximately .04, which is just below the conventional threshold for significance and a strong predictor of replication failure. This concern is magnified because the study falls within the subfield of social priming, an area known for replication difficulties. While the sample size is not extremely small, it is insufficient to lend high confidence to a finding this close to the significance boundary.
---
0.32
The reported p-value, calculated from the t-statistic, is approximately .04, which is only slightly below the standard significance threshold and suggests weak evidence. This fragility is compounded by the small sample size for a between-subjects design, which provides low statistical power for the reported effect size. Furthermore, priming studies in social and cognitive psychology have historically faced challenges with replication.
---
0.28
The reported test statistic yields a p-value just under the .05 significance threshold (p≈.04), a factor strongly linked to lower replicability. This result, combined with the study's low statistical power from a modest sample size and the fact that nonconscious priming effects have historically proven difficult to replicate, suggests a low probability of success. The reporting of the outdated `prep` metric instead of a direct p-value also raises concerns about the robustness of the original finding.
---
0.25
The predicted probability is low primarily because the test statistic is just barely significant (p≈.04), a factor strongly associated with replication failure. The original study was also underpowered to reliably detect its reported small-to-medium effect size (d = .45) with a between-subjects design of N=86. Additionally, the topic of nonconscious priming in social psychology has historically faced significant replication challenges.
---
0.20
The probability is low primarily due to the combination of a p-value just under the .05 significance threshold and the study's subfield. Such ""just-significant"" results (t(84) = 2.09 corresponds to p ≈ .04) often fail to replicate, and social priming research on nonconscious effects has a historically low replication rate. The modest sample size also provides low statistical power to reliably detect the reported small-to-medium effect size, further reducing confidence in the finding."

This study has a very high probability of replication due to the convergence of extremely strong statistical evidence and a solid research design. The reported effect size is exceptionally large (ηp² = .326), and the p-value is highly significant (p < .001), supported by a substantial sample size (N=280). These factors, combined with a standard analysis (GLM) and a controlled experimental context typical of cognitive psychology, point to a robust and easily detectable effect.

This study has a very high probability of replication due to the combination of an extremely large effect size (ηp² = .326) and a highly significant p-value (<.001), which are derived from a substantial sample size (N=280). Such strong statistical evidence for a large effect is unlikely to be a chance finding. The use of a standard general linear model for a controlled perception experiment further increases confidence in the result's robustness.

This prediction is driven by the exceptionally strong statistical evidence for the core finding. The reported effect size is very large (ηp² = .326) and the corresponding p-value is highly significant (p < .001), suggesting a robust phenomenon rather than a statistical artifact. A solid sample size of 280 further increases confidence that a well-powered replication would successfully detect this effect.

This study has a very high probability of successful replication. The reported p‑value is very low (<.001) and the effect size is very large (partial eta-squared = .326), both of which are strong predictors of replicability. Furthermore, the sample size (N=280) is solid for this type of research, and the general linear model is a standard analysis, suggesting the finding is robust and not a statistical artifact.

This study's reported statistics suggest a very high likelihood of successful replication. The combination of a large sample size (N=280), a highly significant p-value (p<.001), and an extremely large effect size (partial eta-squared = .326) indicates a robust and powerful finding. Although social psychology has a mixed replication history, the sheer strength of this statistical evidence greatly outweighs that general concern, making it highly probable the effect is real and not a false positive."

The prediction is high because the paper reports five separate studies, providing strong internal replication for the core finding. The first author is well-established, and the study investigates a variation of the robust anchoring-and-adjustment heuristic. While the sample size for this specific experiment is small and its reported statistics are inconsistent, the conceptual strength and the internal replication across multiple experiments suggest the effect is reliable.

0.65
The p-value is moderately strong (p≈.01, as calculated from the F-statistic), and the implied effect size (η²≈.11) is medium, which are positive indicators for replication. However, the study’s small sample size (N=59) increases the risk of an overestimated effect. More importantly, there is a major inconsistency between the test statistic and the reported effect size (η²=.02), which raises concerns about the accuracy of the report and lowers confidence in the finding.

0.72
The prediction is moderately high because the strong F-statistic (implying p≈.01 and a large effect) investigates a robust cognitive phenomenon using a simple ANOVA. However, confidence is reduced by a major inconsistency, as the reported effect size is small and contradicts the test statistic. This reporting error, combined with the modest sample size, introduces significant uncertainty about the true effect.
---
0.35
The reported effect size is very small (η² = .02), and the sample size (N=59) provides low statistical power to reliably detect it, increasing the chance the original result was a false positive or an overestimate. Although the p-value is significant (the F-statistic corresponds to p≈.01) and the hypothesis builds on the robust anchoring effect, the weak statistical evidence is a strong predictor of replication failure.
---
0.35
This study has a low probability of replication due to major internal inconsistencies among its key statistical metrics and a small sample size. The reported F-value (6.88) contradicts the reported effect size (η² = .02) and p-value surrogate (`prep`), which suggests either significant reporting errors or problematic analytical practices. Although the hypothesis is a plausible extension of a robust effect, such fundamental statistical discrepancies severely undermine the credibility of the original finding."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
Here, we document, for the first time, the pull toward contrasting responses during evaluative thinking, reporting the results of a study examining the trajectory of participants' reaching movements toward different response options. The data for this study come from 141 college-age participants (97 females, 44 males) who responded to 11 yes/no questions presented in random order over headphones. The questions were derived from propositions in the Internet-based Mindpixel project and had varying truth values (defined as the proportion of participants who responded that they were true). These results show that both the spatial extent and the temporal dynamics of motor movements can provide insight into high-level cognition. Our results are consistent with previous claims regarding proposition verification.

Note:
Some subfields—such as social or developmental psychology—have historically shown lower replication rates compared to others like clinical or personality psychology, though individual study quality still matters.",0.82,0.25,0.35,0.35,0.35,0.424,"0.82
This prediction is high primarily due to the very large reported effect size (r = -0.7), as strong signals are more stable and easier to detect in new samples. The participant sample size (N=141) is adequate for a lab-based study, adding to confidence. Although the ANOVA's degrees of freedom F(1, 9) appear oddly low, this likely reflects a conservative analysis across stimulus items, suggesting the effect is robust enough to generalize, which is a positive indicator for replicability.
---
0.25
The primary concern is the extremely low error degrees of freedom (df=9) for a study with 141 participants, which signals a questionable and likely underpowered analysis (e.g., analyzing by item rather than by participant). This, combined with a marginal p-value (<.05), indicates a high risk that the finding is a false positive. While the reported effect size is large, it is likely an inflated estimate resulting from this unusual analytical choice, making a successful replication improbable.
---
0.35
The primary concern is the test statistic, F(1, 9), whose degrees of freedom indicate the analysis was based on a very small sample size (N ≈ 11), likely the study items rather than the 141 participants. While the reported effect size (r = -0.7) is large, findings from small-N analyses are often statistically fragile and their effect sizes can be inflated due to sampling error. The weak statistical foundation for the core claim, despite the plausible theory, lowers the likelihood of successful replication.
---
0.35
Although the participant sample size is adequate (N=141), the test statistic's degrees of freedom (F(1, 9)) strongly suggest the critical analysis was performed on the 11 study items, not the participants. This very small effective sample size (n=11) makes the reported large effect size (r = -0.7) likely to be overestimated and unstable. Such findings, with large effects drawn from small samples, often fail to replicate or show substantially smaller effects.
---
0.35
While the participant sample (N=141) and reported effect size (r=‑0.7) are large, the test statistic's degrees of freedom (F(1, 9)) imply the crucial analysis was based on a very small sample of items (N≈10). This low-powered design for the primary inference substantially increases the risk that the finding was a statistical artifact or is not generalizable to new stimuli. Therefore, despite the strong reported effect, the result is unlikely to replicate."

The likelihood of successful replication is very high due to the combination of a large effect size (d = .93) and a highly significant test statistic (t = 10.36), which suggests a robust underlying phenomenon.

The reported effect size is very large (d = .93), and the corresponding test statistic and p-value indicate a highly significant result that is unlikely to be a statistical artifact. This strong signal, combined with a simple statistical analysis (single-sample t-test) and a respectable sample size (N=125), suggests a robust finding. Therefore, an independent replication is highly likely to find a statistically significant effect in the same direction.

The prediction is high due to the exceptionally large effect size (d = .93) and the extremely robust statistical result (t = 10.36), which corresponds to a very low p‑value. This strong signal, combined with a simple and transparent single-sample t-test analysis and an adequate sample size, makes the original finding very likely to be replicated successfully. The simplicity of the analysis reduces the risk of non-replicability due to hidden analytical flexibility.

This study has a very high probability of successful replication. The reported effect size is large (d = 0.93) and the test statistic is extremely high (t = 10.36), which corresponds to a minuscule p-value and suggests a very robust finding. Furthermore, the simple single-sample t-test design and adequate sample size (N=125) reduce the potential for hidden analytical complexity or an unstable estimate, making the result more likely to be reproduced.

The prediction is high due to the exceptionally large effect size (d=.93) and very strong statistical evidence (t=10.36), which suggest a robust phenomenon. This confidence is bolstered by the adequate sample size (N=125) and the use of a simple, transparent analysis (a single sample t-test), which reduces the chance of the result being a statistical artifact. Although social psychology has a mixed replication history, the sheer magnitude of the reported effect makes it very likely to replicate successfully."

Although the episodic specificity of past events declines as people grow older, it is unknown whether the same is true for future events. In an adapted version of the Autobiographical Interview, young and older participants generated past and future events. Transcriptions were segmented into distinct details that were classified as either internal (episodic) or external. Older adults generated fewer internal details than younger adults for past events, a result replicating previous findings; more important, we show that this deficit extends to future events. Furthermore, the number of internal details and the number of external details both showed correlations between past and future events. Finally, the number of internal details generated by older adults correlated with their relational memory abilities, a finding consistent with the constructive-episodic-simulation hypothesis, which holds that simulation of future episodes requires a system that can flexibly recombine details from past events into novel scenarios.

Some subfields—such as social or developmental psychology—have historically shown lower replication rates compared to others like clinical or personality psychology, though individual study quality still matters.",0.78,0.75,0.82,0.72,0.85,0.784,"0.78
The reported p-value is very low (the F-statistic corresponds to p < .001) and the effect size is very large (ηp² = 0.326), both of which strongly favor replicability. However, the sample size is extremely small (N=32), which can lead to unstable and inflated effect estimates. The study's credibility is bolstered by the high-profile author and the fact that the key finding is a logical extension of previously replicated work, making a successful replication likely despite the sample size concern.
---
0.75
This prediction is moderately high due to the very large reported effect size (ηp²= 0.326) and the correspondingly low p-value, which suggest a robust phenomenon. However, confidence is tempered by the very small sample size (N=32), which often leads to inflated effect size estimates and can reduce the stability of a finding. The fact that the study replicates a known effect (age-related decline for past events) before extending it to a novel domain (future events) lends credibility to the paradigm and the likelihood of a successful replication.
---
0.82
The reported study has a very large effect size (__p^2 = 0.326) and a highly significant p-value (calculated from the F-statistic), which are strong positive predictors of replicability. This confidence is tempered by the small sample size (N=32), which increases the risk that the observed effect is an overestimation. However, the sheer magnitude of the original effect is compelling and suggests the finding is robust enough to likely replicate.
---
0.72
This study has a high likelihood of replication due to its very strong statistical evidence, including a highly significant p-value (p < .001, inferred from the F-statistic) and a large effect size (__p^2=0.326). The primary weakness is the small sample size (N=32), which increases the risk that the effect is overestimated. However, the sheer strength of the reported statistics suggests a robust underlying phenomenon that would likely replicate, especially given the finding is an extension of previously established work.
---
0.85
This study has a high probability of replication due to its very large effect size (ηp² = 0.326) and a highly significant p-value (p < .001, inferred from the F-statistic). Although the small sample size (N=32) is a significant concern because it can inflate effect estimates, the statistical evidence is so strong that the underlying effect is likely to be real and robust. The well-established author further bolsters confidence in the finding."

Some subfields—such as social or developmental psychology—have historically shown lower replication rates compared to others like clinical or personality psychology, though individual study quality still matters.",0.65,0.68,0.68,0.75,0.65,0.682,"0.65
The reported p-value is very small (p < .01 based on the t‑statistic), and the effect size is medium, both of which strongly support replicability. However, the very small sample size (N=32) means the effect size estimate is imprecise and the original study had low statistical power, casting significant doubt on the stability of the finding. The simple analysis is a positive factor, but the low sample size remains a primary concern.
---
0.68
The reported statistics provide strong evidence for the effect (a t-test yielding p ≈ .003), and the medium effect size is promising. However, the very small sample size (N=32) is a major concern, as findings from such studies can be unstable and effect size estimates are often inflated. Therefore, while the statistical signal is strong, the small sample tempers confidence in a successful replication.
---
0.68
This prediction balances the study's key strength, a highly significant p-value (t(31)=3.23 corresponds to p≈.003) and a medium effect size, against its primary weakness of a very small sample. While the strong statistical evidence suggests the effect is not a fluke, the small sample means the effect size estimate may be inflated, reducing confidence in a successful replication. The straightforward experimental design and simple t‑test analysis are positive indicators that increase the probability of replication success.
---
0.75
The prediction is relatively high due to the very strong statistical evidence (a t‑statistic of 3.23 corresponds to a p‑value of approximately .003), which is a primary predictor of replication success. However, this confidence is tempered by the small sample size (N=32), which can lead to inflated effect size estimates and increases the risk of a chance finding. The study's use of a simple, standard analysis (t‑test) and a theoretically plausible finding within cognitive development partially offsets the risk from the small sample.
---
0.65
The reported p-value is strong (p ≈ .003, inferred from the t-statistic) and the medium effect size is encouraging. However, the small sample size of 32 is a significant concern, as results from underpowered studies can be less stable and effect sizes may be inflated. The study's focus on experimenter-child interaction in a developmental context also introduces potential complexities that can be difficult to standardize perfectly across replication labs."

We recruited 428 participants from an Internet-based subject pool and asked them eight questions probing their real-world knowledge. Although people assume that their first guess about a matter of fact exhausts the best information available to them, a forced second guess contributes additional information, such that the average of two guesses is better than either guess alone. This observed benefit of averaging multiple responses from the same person suggests that responses made by a subject are sampled from an internal probability distribution, rather than deterministically selected on the basis of all the knowledge a subject has.

- Sample size: 173
- Analysis type (e.g. rm ANOVA, mixed ANOVA, regression, t‑test): dependent samples t-test
- Test statistic: t(172) = 3.94
- Reported p‑value: <.01
- Effect size (e.g. Cohen’s d, r): d = 0.47
- First author’s citation count: 2785
- Subfield: Cognitive, Social

Some subfields—such as social or developmental psychology—have historically shown lower replication rates compared to others like clinical or personality psychology, though individual study quality still matters.",0.92,0.85,0.9,0.85,0.88,0.88,"0.92
The study has several strengths pointing to high replicability. The sample size is adequate, the analysis is a simple dependent t-test, and the resulting statistics are strong, with a p-value well under .05 and a moderate effect size (d=0.47). The finding is also a plausible extension of the well-established ""wisdom of crowds"" phenomenon within the subfield of cognitive psychology, which tends to have more robust experimental effects.

0.85
The study has a high likelihood of replication due to its adequate sample size, a strong p-value (<.01), and a respectable effect size (d=0.47). The use of a simple dependent t‑test for analysis reduces the risk of spurious findings from analytical flexibility. This combination of solid evidence and a straightforward design suggests the effect is robust.

The study has a high probability of replication due to its strong statistical evidence, including a large sample size (N=173) and a highly significant p-value (p<.01). The simple, low-flexibility analysis (dependent t-test) and a plausible, moderate effect size (d=0.47) further increase confidence that the finding is robust.
---
0.85
The reported p-value is very low (<.01) and derived from a strong test statistic (t=3.94), which is the most reliable predictor of replication success. The study uses a simple within-subjects design with a respectable sample size (N=173), and the first author is highly cited, all of which are positive indicators. While the reported effect size is only small-to-medium, the strength of the other statistical evidence points to a high likelihood of a successful replication.
---
0.88
The prediction is high due to a combination of strong statistical evidence and a robust study design. The reported p-value is very low (t(172)=3.94), and the sample size of 173 provides good statistical power to detect the reported medium effect size (d=0.47). Furthermore, the use of a simple dependent samples t-test within a straightforward experimental paradigm suggests the finding is unlikely to be an artifact of complex analysis or procedure."

This prediction is high due to the extremely large effect size (ηp² = .308) and highly significant p‑value (<.00001). While the sample size (N=12) is very small, this weakness is substantially mitigated by the use of a powerful within‑subjects ANOVA design, which is common in cognitive psychology and suggests many repeated measurements per participant. The combination of a strong design and a massive reported effect makes successful replication very likely.

This study reports an extremely small p-value (<.00001) and a very large effect size (partial eta-squared = .308), which are strong indicators of a replicable result. Although the sample size of 12 is very small, this is typical for within-subjects cognitive paradigms like the attentional blink, where statistical power is derived from many repeated trials per participant. The robust nature of the underlying phenomenon and the strong statistical evidence suggest a high likelihood of replication.

Despite a very small sample size (N=12), replication is highly likely due to the extremely strong evidence reported. The very low p‑value (<.00001) and large effect size (ηp^2 = .308) suggest a powerful and easily detectable effect, which is common for robust phenomena like the attentional blink in cognitive psychology. While the small N introduces some uncertainty, the strength of the signal in this powerful within-subjects design makes a successful replication probable.

0.65
This study reports an extremely large effect size (partial eta-squared = .308) and a highly significant p-value, which strongly favor successful replication. However, the sample size is very small (N=12), which is a primary risk factor for replicability as it can lead to overestimated effects. While the reported degrees of freedom for the F-test seem inconsistent with the sample size and may suggest an analytical error, the sheer magnitude of the reported effect within a robust cognitive paradigm (the attentional blink) makes it likely that a well-powered replication would also find a significant result.

This study has a high probability of replication despite its very small sample size (N=12). The extremely small p-value (<.00001) and very large effect size (partial eta-squared = .308) indicate a powerful and statistically robust effect that is unlikely to be a chance finding. While small samples are a risk, this effect is found within a classic cognitive psychology paradigm (attentional blink) where large, consistent within-subject effects often allow for high power even with few participants."

This prediction is low primarily because the study tests the glucose model of ego depletion, a hypothesis that has performed very poorly in large-scale, pre-registered replication projects. Furthermore, the key statistical result is only marginally significant (the p-value is approximately .023, calculated from the F-statistic) and represents a small effect size (ηp² = .045). Such findings are often less robust and harder to replicate than those with stronger evidence.

0.15
The study's focus on the glucose model of self-control is a major red flag, as this is a highly controversial area with a history of failed replications. The reported p-value (approximately .023, calculated from the F-statistic) is weak, falling in a range that is only marginally significant and susceptible to questionable research practices. These factors, combined with a complex experimental design and a modest effect size, strongly suggest that the finding is unlikely to replicate successfully.
---
0.10
This low prediction is primarily driven by the study's topic, the glucose model of ego depletion, which has famously failed to replicate in large, pre-registered studies. The reported p-value is also just under the traditional .05 threshold (an F of 5.31 with these degrees of freedom is p=.023), and such ""barely significant"" results are known to have lower replication rates. These major concerns outweigh the study's moderate sample size and straightforward ANOVA analysis.

0.15
This prediction is very low because the study tests the glucose model of ego depletion, a theory with a well-documented history of major replication failures. The statistical evidence is also weak, with a small effect size (ηp² = .045) and a corresponding p-value (p ≈ .023) that is close to the significance threshold, suggesting the finding may not be robust. These factors combined make a successful replication highly unlikely.
---
0.15
The predicted probability of replication is very low due to multiple risk factors. The study's topic, ego depletion and its proposed glucose mechanism, is a subfield of social psychology that has notoriously poor replication rates. The statistical evidence itself is weak: the p-value (p≈.023, inferred from the F-statistic) is close to the .05 threshold, and the effect size (ηp² = .045) is small, suggesting the original finding could be a false positive given the modest sample size."

Affective and motivational variables influence the magnitude of the ERN, which suggests that the ERN may relate to emotional or motivational aspects of error detection. In the present study, we evaluated the possibility that errors prime defensive motivational responses, and that the ERN may predict the magnitude of defensive reactivity after errors.

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
The error-related negativity (ERN) is a negative deflection in the event-related potential that is maximal approximately 50 ms after the commission of an error. The ERN is generated in the anterior cingulate cortex, a region of the medial prefrontal cortex implicated in both cognitive and emotional processing. Affective and motivational variables influence the magnitude of the ERN, which suggests that the ERN may relate to emotional or motivational aspects of error detection. In the present study, we evaluated the possibility that errors prime defensive motivational responses, and that the ERN may predict the magnitude of defensive reactivity after errors. We found that (a) the defensive startle response was larger following errors than following correct responses, and (b) the magnitude of the ERN predicted the degree of startle potentiation following errors. Thus, response errors prime defensive motivation-and the ERN predicts individual differences in the aversive response to errors.

The primary concerns are the small sample size and the imprecise p-value (p<.05), which suggest the finding is statistically fragile and the reported medium effect size is likely an overestimation. While the simple correlational analysis and use of objective psychophysiological measures are strengths, the low statistical power of the original study substantially lowers the probability of a successful replication.

0.35
The primary drivers for this low estimate are the small sample size (N=31) and the p-value being just under the .05 threshold. Small samples have low statistical power and tend to produce inflated effect size estimates, while ""just significant"" p-values are empirically associated with lower replication rates. Although the analysis is straightforward, these fundamental statistical weaknesses suggest a high probability of replication failure.
---
0.32
The very small sample size (N=31) and a p-value just below the .05 threshold are strong predictors of replication failure, as they suggest low statistical power and a potentially unstable result. While the zero-order correlation is a simple analysis, the observed medium effect size is likely inflated due to the small sample. The complexity of processing psychophysiological data (ERPs) can also introduce hidden variability that lowers replicability.
---
0.35
The primary predictors of replication failure are present: a small sample size (N=31) and a p-value reported just below the conventional threshold of significance (p<.05). While the reported effect size is medium, it is likely an overestimation due to the low statistical power of the original study. The author's high citation count is a modest positive factor, but it is unlikely to outweigh the weak statistical evidence for the claim.
---
0.35
This prediction is low due to the combination of a small sample size (N=31) and a p-value just below the standard .05 threshold. Such a result has low statistical power and suggests the reported medium effect size (r=-.38) may be an overestimation. While the correlation analysis is straightforward, the weak statistical evidence makes a successful replication unlikely."

This prediction is moderately high due to conflicting signals. The primary weakness is the extremely small sample size (N=12), which makes the study susceptible to sampling error and suggests the massive effect size (d=3.25) is likely an overestimation. However, the statistical evidence from that sample is exceptionally strong (t=5.39), meaning the result is not borderline and a true, non-zero effect is likely present, which a well-powered replication would probably detect successfully.

The probability of replication is low due to the extremely small sample size (N=12), which is common in costly fMRI studies but highly underpowered. This small sample has likely produced a vastly inflated effect size estimate (d=3.25), a statistical artifact known as the winner's curse. Although the reported p-value is very strong, the instability of the initial finding makes a successful replication with a more appropriately sized sample unlikely.

The primary reason for the low replication probability is the extremely small sample size (N=12). While the reported p‑value is very low and the effect size is massive (d=3.25), these metrics are highly unreliable and likely inflated in such a small sample. Neuroimaging studies are also complex and expensive, and historically have had issues with replicability due to low statistical power and analytical flexibility.

The prediction is low primarily due to the extremely small sample size (N=12), which makes the reported findings highly uncertain and prone to error. This small sample likely produced a vastly inflated effect size (d=3.25), and a replication study would almost certainly observe a much smaller effect that may fail to reach statistical significance. Although the author is experienced, the combination of a tiny sample and a massive effect in an fMRI study is a strong indicator of low replicability.

The primary concern for replication is the extremely small sample size (N=12), which makes the statistical estimates highly unstable. Consequently, the reported effect size (d=3.25) is almost certainly inflated and unlikely to be observed again in a new, larger sample. Although the p-value is very low, such significant results from underpowered studies often fail to replicate because the initial finding was due to chance."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
The representation of visual information inside the focus of attention is more precise than the representation of information outside the focus of attention. We found that the visual system can compensate for the cost of withdrawing attention by pooling noisy local features and computing summary statistics. The location of an individual object is a local feature, whereas the center of mass of several objects (centroid) is a summary feature representing the mean object location. Three experiments showed that withdrawing attention degraded the representation of individual positions more than the representation of the centroid. It appears that information outside the focus of attention can be represented at an abstract level that lacks local detail, but nevertheless carries a precise statistical summary of the scene. The term ensemble features refers to a broad class of statistical summary features that we propose collectively make up the representation of information outside the focus of attention.

Key details:
- Sample size: 8
- Analysis type (e.g. rm ANOVA, mixed ANOVA, regression, t‑test): dependent samples t-test

The prediction is low primarily because the extremely small sample size (N=8) makes the finding statistically fragile and the large effect size estimate unreliable. The reported p-value of 0.028 is close to the significance threshold, which further suggests the result may not be robust to resampling. These severe statistical weaknesses outweigh the positives of a simple analysis within the cognitive subfield.
---
0.35
The prediction is low primarily due to the extremely small sample size (N=8) and a p‑value (p=0.028) that is only marginally significant. Such small‑N studies often produce unstable results and inflated effect sizes, making the very large reported effect (dz=0.976) suspect. While the author is well‑cited and the analysis is simple, the weak statistical evidence makes a successful replication unlikely.
---
0.35
The primary reasons for the low predicted probability are the extremely small sample size (N=8) and a p-value (0.028) that is just below the conventional significance threshold. While the reported effect size is large, it is likely inflated due to the low-powered design, and such findings are often difficult to replicate. Although the simple analysis and cognitive subfield are positive signs, the weak statistical evidence makes a successful replication questionable.
---
0.35
This study has a very high risk of non-replication. The primary concerns are the extremely small sample size of 8 participants and a p-value of 0.028, which is close to the significance threshold and a strong negative predictor of success. While the reported effect size is very large, such estimates from underpowered studies are often substantially inflated and unreliable.
---
0.65
This prediction is moderate due to conflicting signals. The extremely small sample size (N=8) and a p-value (0.028) that is just below the significance threshold are strong negative predictors of success, as the large reported effect size is likely inflated. However, the study's design, which established the finding across three separate experiments in the more robust subfield of cognitive psychology, suggests the underlying effect is real and not a statistical fluke."

The study's extremely small sample size (N=36) provides low statistical power and suggests the large reported effect size is likely inflated. Although the F-statistic corresponds to a significant p-value (p ≈ .02), this value is in a range that has been shown to have a low replication rate. The combination of a small sample and a marginal p-value in a social psychology experiment with a complex manipulation points to a low probability of successful replication.
---
0.25
The extremely small sample size (N=36) is the primary concern, as it greatly increases the chance of a false positive and leads to imprecise, likely inflated, effect size estimates. Although the reported effect size is large and the result is statistically significant (the F-statistic corresponds to p≈.02), p-values in this range from small studies have a poor track record of replication. The complex social-psychological nature of the study also introduces potential variability that can make replication more challenging.
---
0.25
The prediction is low primarily due to the very small sample size (N=36) for a study comparing groups, which makes the finding unstable and likely to be a false positive or an overestimate. The corresponding p-value (p ≈ .02, calculated from the F-statistic) is close to the .05 threshold, a range known to have lower replicability. The large reported effect size is likely inflated due to the small sample, meaning a well-powered replication would probably find a much smaller, and potentially non-significant, effect.

The primary concern is the extremely small sample size (N=36), which provides very low statistical power and leads to unstable and likely inflated estimates. Although the effect size is reported as large (ηp² = .147) and the F-statistic yields a significant p-value (p ≈ .02), these findings are highly suspect given the sample size and are unlikely to be reproduced in a well-powered replication. The low author citation count and the reliance on a subtle experimental manipulation in social psychology further decrease confidence.
---
0.20
The prediction is low primarily due to the extremely small sample size (N=36), which makes the study statistically underpowered and the findings unstable. This low power means the reported p‑value (equivalent to p≈.02) is not very convincing and the large effect size is likely an overestimation. Additionally, social psychology studies involving subtle experimental manipulations on abstract constructs have historically shown lower rates of successful replication."

The probability of replication is very high due to the combination of an extremely low p-value (p < .0001) and a large effect size (d = -.94), which are the strongest predictors of success. Although the sample size is modest, the finding's robustness is bolstered by the use of a simple, powerful analysis (paired t-test) appropriate for a within-subjects design. These factors indicate a strong, easily detectable phenomenon that is likely to be replicated.

The very low p-value and large effect size (d = -0.94) provide strong evidence for a robust phenomenon. While the sample size is modest, the effect's sheer magnitude suggests it is not a statistical artifact and should be readily detectable in a new sample. Additionally, the study's focus on a basic perceptual effect using a simple, standard analysis (paired t-test) further increases the likelihood of successful replication.

0.92
This study has a very high probability of successful replication due to its extremely low p-value and large effect size (d = -0.94), which strongly suggest a robust finding. The use of a simple paired t-test minimizes concerns about analytical flexibility, and the powerful within-subjects design makes the modest sample size sufficient to detect such a large effect. Cognitive studies on basic perceptual phenomena like this one also tend to have high replicability.

0.92
This study has a very high probability of replication due to the convergence of several strong positive indicators. The reported p-value is extremely low (p < .0001) and the effect size is large (d = -0.94), both of which are the best predictors of replication success. Although the sample size is modest, the powerful within-subjects design, simple analysis (t-test), and use of a basic perceptual illusion—a type of finding known for its robustness in cognitive psychology—all suggest the effect is real and readily detectable.

0.92
The prediction is high due to the extremely low p‑value (p = .00003) and large effect size (d = ‑0.94), which strongly suggest a robust finding that is likely to replicate. While the sample size is modest, the statistical evidence is compelling, and the study's use of a simple analysis on a perceptual phenomenon—a type of finding that often replicates well—further increases confidence."

This study has a very low probability of replication due to its extremely small sample size (N=28), which provides low statistical power and can lead to inflated effect size estimates. The test statistic corresponds to a p-value just at the edge of significance (p≈.05), a range in which replication success is notoriously poor. The complex interaction effect found is also inherently more difficult to reproduce than a simple main effect, further reducing the likelihood of a successful replication.
---
0.15
The likelihood of successful replication is low due to the combination of a very small sample size (N=28) and a reported test statistic (F(1,26)=4.17) that is only marginally significant (p≈.05). Small, low-power studies that yield barely significant results often have inflated effect sizes and a high probability of being false positives. The complexity of the interaction-based finding further reduces the chance that this specific pattern of results would emerge again in a new sample.
---
0.15
This prediction is low due to a convergence of negative factors. The sample size (N=28) is very small for detecting an interaction in a mixed ANOVA, which leads to low statistical power and unstable estimates. The test statistic yields a p-value very close to the conventional .05 threshold, a range notorious for low replicability. While the effect size is large, it is likely inflated due to the small sample size (a phenomenon known as the ""winner's curse"").

0.15
The likelihood of successful replication is very low. The study's sample size (N=28) is extremely small for a mixed ANOVA, which drastically increases the chance of a false positive and inflates the effect size estimate. Most importantly, the reported test statistic corresponds to a p-value just over the conventional .05 threshold, and the use of the discredited *p*-rep metric strongly suggests the original finding was not statistically significant. A fragile, complex interaction found under these conditions is highly unlikely to replicate.

0.15
This study has a very low probability of replication due to several major red flags. The sample size (N=28) is extremely small, which provides low statistical power and yields unstable estimates. Furthermore, the test statistic corresponds to a p-value of approximately .051, which is not statistically significant and suggests a very weak signal, while the complex interaction effect found is inherently difficult to reproduce. The large reported effect size is likely an overestimate, a common issue in underpowered studies."

The prediction is low primarily due to the very small sample size (N=25), which increases the likelihood of both a false positive result and an inflated effect size estimate. Although the reported p-value is low (<.005) and the effect size is large (ηp² = .18), this pattern is characteristic of the ""winner's curse"" where initial, small-N studies that find significant results often overestimate the true effect. The study's focus on a subtle social-cognitive phenomenon, a topic within a subfield with historically mixed replication rates, adds to the uncertainty.

The prediction is low primarily due to the very small sample size (N=25), which increases the likelihood of a false positive and produces statistically unstable estimates. While the p-value is strong, the large reported effect size (ηp² = .18) is almost certainly an overestimation due to this small sample, a phenomenon known as the ""winner's curse."" A well-powered replication would likely find a much smaller true effect, significantly lowering the chance of achieving statistical significance.

0.35
The probability of replication is low primarily due to the very small sample size (N=25), which yields unstable estimates and increases the likelihood that the finding is a false positive, despite the strong p-value and large reported effect size. Furthermore, the complex mixed ANOVA design introduces analytical flexibility that can reduce replicability, and the study’s focus on subtle social cues may not be robust across different contexts.
---
0.38
The study's primary weakness is its very small sample size (N=25), which increases the likelihood of a false positive and means the reported large effect size (ηp² = .18) is likely inflated. While the low p-value (<.005) is a positive indicator, it is not reliable given the small sample. The complex social nature of the eye-tracking task may also be sensitive to subtle variations in stimuli or participants, further challenging direct replication.
---
0.35
The primary reason for the low replication probability is the very small sample size (N=25), which makes the findings less stable and increases the chance of a false positive. While the p-value is low and the reported effect size is large, such results from underpowered studies are often inflated and likely to shrink substantially in a replication attempt. The study’s home in social psychology, a subfield with historically lower replication rates, also slightly tempers expectations for success."

While the very small sample size (N=24) and a p-value just under the conventional threshold (p≈.025) pose significant risks for replication, the reported effect size is exceptionally large (ηp² = .20). The study investigates a fundamental memory effect within cognitive psychology, a subfield with a history of more robust findings. Replication success likely depends on whether the true effect is close to what was reported or if the initial result was an overestimate, a common issue in small-N studies.
---
0.78
The reported effect size is large (ηp² = .20) and was found using a powerful within‑subjects design, both of which are positive indicators for replication. However, the sample size is very small (N=24) and the p-value is relatively close to the .05 threshold (p≈.025 based on the F-statistic), which introduces risk. Overall, the robust nature of cognitive memory paradigms and the large effect suggest a high probability of a successful replication, even if the true effect is smaller than what was observed here.

0.72
This study's powerful within-subjects design and very large reported effect size (ηp² = .20) suggest a robust cognitive phenomenon. However, the very small sample size (N=24) and a p-value that is significant but not overwhelmingly strong (p≈.025 based on the F-statistic) introduce notable uncertainty. While the effect is likely real, its magnitude may be overestimated in the original study, making a direct replication moderately likely to succeed.
---
0.78
The prediction is moderately high due to a very large reported effect size (ηp² = .20) from a highly-cited author, suggesting a robust finding. However, this confidence is tempered by the very small sample size (N=24) and a p-value (calculated as p≈.025 from the F-statistic) that is significant but not overwhelmingly so. While the powerful within-subjects design and large effect are strong positive indicators, small-N studies are prone to inflated effect sizes and have higher replication variance.
---
0.78
This study will likely replicate due to its very large reported effect size (ηp² = .20) and the use of a powerful within‑subjects design, which is typical for robust findings in cognitive psychology. However, confidence is reduced by the very small sample size (N=24) and a p‑value that is likely close to the .05 significance threshold, increasing the risk that the original effect size was overestimated. The straightforward experimental paradigm and high author citation count are further positive indicators, but the small sample remains the primary concern."

The prediction is low due to the combination of a small effect size (pr = .21) and a relatively small sample size (N = 119). This pairing suggests the original study had low statistical power, which increases the likelihood that the initial significant result was a chance finding or an overestimation of the true effect. The reported p‑value is not strong enough to overcome these primary risk factors for replication failure.
---
0.40
The primary concerns are the small sample size (N=119) and the small effect size (pr = .21), which combine to create low statistical power. This means the original finding, while statistically significant (the reported `prep` = .92 corresponds to p ≈ .015), is based on an imprecise estimate that is highly susceptible to sampling error. Therefore, a well‑powered independent replication may fail to find a significant effect, or may find a true effect that is even smaller.
---
0.32
This study has several indicators of low replicability. The sample size is small (N=119), the effect size is small (pr=.21), and the reported p‑value (inferred from the outdated `prep` statistic) is likely very close to the .05 threshold for significance. This combination suggests the original result may be a false positive or that the effect size is substantially overestimated. Furthermore, the topic is from social psychology, a subfield with historically mixed replication success.
---
0.38
This prediction is low primarily due to the combination of a small effect size (pr = .21) and a relatively small sample size (N = 119). Studies with this profile are often underpowered, increasing the risk that the original finding was a false positive or that the effect size was overestimated. While the first author is highly cited, the statistical properties of the original finding are stronger predictors of replication success and suggest a high likelihood of failure.
---
0.45
The prediction is below 0.5 primarily due to the combination of a small effect size (pr = .21) and a relatively modest sample size (N = 119). This pairing results in low statistical power, meaning a replication attempt with a similar sample would have a substantial chance of producing a non-significant result even if a true effect exists. While the reported p-value is not borderline (equivalent to p ≈ .01), the study's subfield (social psychology) and its use of a complex mediation analysis introduce additional uncertainty, lowering the probability of a successful replication."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
People are able to explicitly resist using knowledge about one person to evaluate another person from the same group. After learning about positive and negative behaviors performed by one individual from each of two different groups, participants were introduced briefly to new individuals from the groups. Implicit evaluations of the original individuals readily generalized to the new individuals; explicitly, participants resisted such generalization. Days later, both implicit and explicit evaluations of the original individuals generalized to the new individuals. The results suggest that associative links (e.g., shared group membership) are sufficient for implicit attitude generalization, but deliberative logic (e.g., individual group members are not necessarily the same) can reduce explicit generalization by association. When knowledge distinguishing who did what is unavailable, such as after forgetting, associative knowledge provides the basis of explicit evaluation. We conclude that a simple association linking one individual to another can produce implicit attitude generalization immediately and explicit attitude generalization eventually.

Despite the large sample size, which lends precision to the estimate, the reported effect size (d = -0.004) and test statistic (t = -0.11) are both virtually zero. This indicates a clear null result, which a well-powered replication is very likely to reproduce. The probability of achieving a ""successful"" replication, defined as finding a statistically significant effect (p < .05), is therefore extremely low and would likely only occur by chance.

0.15
The reported effect size is extremely small (d = -0.004) and the test statistic is non-significant (t = -0.11), suggesting the data provide strong evidence for a null effect. Although the sample size is large, this only increases confidence that the true effect is negligible. A successful replication typically requires finding a significant effect, making it highly unlikely here despite the simple analysis type.

0.02
The prediction is extremely low because the key metrics from the original study indicate a clear null finding. The reported effect size is negligible (d = -0.004) and the test statistic (t(562) = -0.11) is far from statistically significant, corresponding to a p-value of approximately 0.91. Although the large sample size provides a precise estimate, it precisely estimates a null effect, making a replication with a significant result highly improbable.

0.01
The reported effect size (d = -0.004) is negligibly small, and the test statistic (t = -0.11) indicates a clear null result, which was not statistically significant. Although the sample size (N=564) is very large, this only increases our confidence that the true effect is indeed close to zero. Therefore, a replication study is extremely unlikely to find a statistically significant effect.

0.05
The study's reported statistics provide exceptionally weak evidence for the effect, making a successful replication highly improbable. Despite the very large sample size, the effect size is virtually zero (d = -0.004) and the corresponding p‑value is far from significant (p ≈ .91). A well-powered study that finds a null result is strong evidence for the absence of a meaningful effect, so a replication is extremely unlikely to find a significant result."

The probability of a successful replication is low, primarily due to the very small sample size (N=30), which provides insufficient statistical power and leads to unstable, likely overestimated results. While the p-value is small, the enormous reported effect size (d=.88) is implausible for a subtle social priming manipulation, a type of study that has a known history of replication failures. The combination of these factors strongly suggests the original finding is not robust.
---
0.15
Despite a significant p-value and a large reported effect size, the extremely small sample size (N=30) makes these results highly suspect and suggests the study is severely underpowered. Social psychology studies involving subtle behavioral priming have a poor track record of successful replication, especially when the reported effect size is large but derived from a small sample. Therefore, the likelihood that the true effect is much smaller or zero is high, making a successful independent replication improbable.
---
0.15
This study's very small sample size (N=30) provides low statistical power, making the results less reliable and increasing the chance that the large reported effect size (d=.88) is an overestimation. The study design, which uses a subtle prime to influence complex behavior, falls into a subfield of social psychology that has historically suffered from low replication rates. While the p-value is low, this is less meaningful in the context of such a small sample.
---
0.25
The study's primary weakness is its extremely small sample size (N=30), which provides low statistical power and produces unstable estimates. While the reported effect size is large (d=.88), such large effects found in small-N studies are often highly inflated and difficult to replicate. The finding, which involves a subtle priming manipulation influencing a complex social behavior, belongs to a research area in social psychology that has historically shown low replication rates.
---
0.25
This prediction is low due to several converging risk factors. The sample size (N=30) is very small for a between-subjects design, making the finding less reliable and the very large effect size (d=0.88) likely an overestimate. Furthermore, this type of subtle behavioral manipulation study from social psychology has historically shown low rates of successful replication."

The extremely small sample size (N=4) severely undermines confidence in the stability of the finding and suggests the enormous reported effect size (η² = .74) is likely an overestimation. While the low p‑value and the nature of the study (a controlled perceptual experiment) are positive indicators, the risk of the result being a statistical artifact or not generalizable due to the tiny sample is very high. Therefore, the probability of a successful replication is low.

0.35
The primary concern is the extremely small sample size (N=4), which severely undermines the stability and generalizability of the findings. While the reported p-value is low (.005) and the effect size is very large (η² = .74), such statistics are often highly inflated and unreliable when derived from a tiny sample. Therefore, a new, independent sample is unlikely to reproduce an effect of this magnitude, making a successful replication improbable.
---
0.68
The extremely small sample size (N=4) is a significant weakness, making the result potentially unstable and sensitive to outliers. However, this concern is partially offset by the very large reported effect size (_^2 = .74) and a highly significant p-value, which suggest a strong and consistent phenomenon within the tested sample. Studies on basic cognitive perception, like this one, can sometimes reveal robust effects that are replicable even if the original study was underpowered.
---
0.35
The primary factor reducing the predicted replication success is the extremely small sample size (N=4), which creates a high risk of a statistically spurious result and a massively inflated effect size estimate. While the reported p‑value is low and the effect size (η² = .74) is very large, these figures are unreliable with such a tiny sample. Even if the effect is real, its true magnitude is likely much smaller, making a direct replication less likely to succeed.

The predicted replication probability is very low due to the extremely small sample size (N=4). While the study reports a highly significant p-value and a very large effect size, results from such a tiny sample are highly unstable and prone to being statistical flukes or dramatic overestimations. Even though within-subjects cognitive studies can be powerful, an N of 4 provides very weak evidence that the finding is a generalizable phenomenon rather than an artifact of the specific individuals tested."

The small sample size (N=84) is a significant risk factor, as underpowered studies that find significant results often have inflated effect sizes; the reported partial eta-squared of .11 is very large for this type of subtle priming manipulation. Although the p-value is low (p≈.009), findings from this subfield of social-cognitive priming have historically shown low replication rates. These factors combined suggest a low probability of a successful independent replication.

This study has a high risk of replication failure due to several factors. The topic, social priming, is a subfield notorious for poor replicability, and the small sample size (N=84) means the study was likely underpowered, which inflates the reported large effect size and increases the chance of a false positive. While the p-value appears strong, the use of the outdated `prep` statistic and the clever but potentially fragile priming manipulation are characteristic of an era of research that has since been shown to have a low replication rate.

The prediction is low due to the study's topic—social priming—which has a well-documented history of poor replicability. Although the reported p-value is strong (p ≈ .009) and the effect size is large, the small sample size (N≈28 per group) suggests the study was underpowered and the reported effect is likely an overestimation. Such surprising findings based on subtle manipulations have often failed in subsequent, higher-powered replication attempts.

0.35
While the reported statistics are strong (p≈.009, large effect size), the study’s small sample size for a between-subjects design suggests it was underpowered and the effect size may be inflated. The research falls into the category of social/embodied priming, a subfield with a well-documented history of low replication rates for subtle manipulations. These contextual and methodological factors substantially lower the likelihood of replication success despite the significant p-value.

0.25
The probability of replication is low primarily due to the small sample size (N=84), which provides low statistical power and increases the chance of a spurious finding. Furthermore, the study's topic of spatial priming falls within social psychology, a subfield with a documented history of replication difficulties for these types of subtle effects. The combination of a small sample with a large reported effect size (ηp² = .11) is a classic indicator of a potentially fragile or overestimated result."

The primary predictor of high replicability here is the exceptionally large test statistic (F=192.89), which implies a massive and highly robust effect size that is very unlikely to be a false positive. While the sample size is moderate, it is more than adequate to detect such a strong signal. The standard experimental design and analysis (RM ANOVA) further increase confidence that the finding is not due to obscure or problematic methods.

The prediction is very high primarily due to the exceptionally large F-statistic (F=192.89), which implies a massive effect size that should be readily detectable even with a moderate sample. While the sample size (N=82) is not huge, it is sufficient for the reported repeated-measures design, and the controlled laboratory setting with a standard analysis enhances the potential for a successful replication. The very low p-value further strengthens confidence in the robustness of the original finding.

The prediction is high primarily due to the extremely large F‑statistic and correspondingly low p‑value, which imply a massive effect size that should be easily detectable. While the sample size is modest and social psychology findings can be context-dependent, the sheer strength of the statistical evidence strongly suggests the effect is robust.

The prediction is high due to the exceptionally strong evidence for the effect. The reported p‑value is very low (p < .001) and the F‑statistic is massive, which implies an extremely large effect size that would be easy to detect even in a small sample. Although the sample of 82 is not large, the within‑subjects design provides high statistical power for such a robust effect.

This study has a very high probability of replication due to its extremely large test statistic (F=192.89), which implies a massive and robust effect size. While the sample size of 82 is only moderate, the highly significant p‑value (p<.001) and the sheer magnitude of the reported effect overwhelm concerns typically associated with the social psychology subfield. The straightforward experimental design and established author also point toward a replicable finding."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
People are motivated to maintain social connection with others, and those who lack social connection with other humans may try to compensate by creating a sense of human connection with nonhuman agents.

The prediction for a lower likelihood of replication success is driven primarily by the small sample size (N=57), which is insufficient for a complex mixed ANOVA and creates a high risk of an inflated effect size. The reported p‑value of .01, while significant, is not overwhelmingly strong and is a known indicator of lower replicability. Although the author is well-established, these statistical weaknesses present a substantial challenge to reproducing the original finding.
---
0.35
This prediction is low primarily due to the small sample size (N=57), which makes the study underpowered and the reported large effect size (η² = .12) likely to be an overestimation. While the p-value of 0.01 is statistically significant, it is not low enough to overcome the high risk of a false positive associated with small samples. Additionally, findings in social psychology with moderately complex analyses like a mixed ANOVA have historically shown lower rates of successful replication.
---
0.35
The primary concern is the very small sample size (N=57) for a study using a complex mixed ANOVA, which reduces confidence in the stability of the findings. While the p-value is significant (p=.01) and the effect size is large (η²=.12), such results are often inflated in underpowered studies and may not hold up in a larger replication attempt. The subfield of social psychology has also historically faced challenges with replicability for theoretically plausible effects like this one.
---
0.35
The primary concern is the small sample size (N=57), which provides low power and can produce unstable, inflated effect size estimates. While the reported effect size (ηp² =.12) is large and the p‑value is significant (p=.01), these promising metrics are less trustworthy in an underpowered study. The high risk of the original finding being a statistical artifact or a substantial overestimation suggests a low probability of replication.
---
0.25
The prediction is low primarily due to the very small sample size (N=57), which makes the finding less reliable and suggests the large reported effect size (η²=.12) is likely inflated. Furthermore, the p-value of .01 is not exceptionally strong, and studies from the subfield of social psychology have historically demonstrated lower rates of successful replication. The moderately complex analysis (mixed ANOVA) also introduces potential challenges for a direct replication."

The study has a high likelihood of replication due to an extremely large effect size (__p^2 = .59) and a highly significant p‑value, both strong predictors of replicability. This powerful result is supported by a large sample size (N=240) and a straightforward statistical analysis (t-test/ANOVA). While the study introduces a novel paradigm, the sheer magnitude of the effect suggests it is robust.
---
0.92
The prediction is high due to the exceptionally large reported effect size (ηp² = .59) and the correspondingly extreme F‑statistic and p‑value, which suggest a very strong and clear finding. A large effect is less likely to be a statistical artifact and is robust enough to withstand sampling variation in a replication attempt. Although the sample size (N=240) is only moderate, it is more than adequate to reliably detect an effect of this immense magnitude.
---
0.92
This study has an extremely high probability of replication. The reported effect size (ηp² = .59) is exceptionally large, and the statistical evidence is overwhelming (F(1, 76) = 109.74, p ≈ 0) given the respectable sample size (N=240). An effect this strong and statistically unambiguous, derived from a simple analysis, is very unlikely to be a statistical artifact and suggests a robust underlying phenomenon that should be readily observed in a direct replication.
---
0.92
The prediction for a high probability of replication is driven by the exceptionally strong statistical evidence: the p‑value is effectively zero and the effect size is very large (ηp^2 = .59). A robust sample size of 240 for a lab experiment provides high statistical power to detect such a large effect. Furthermore, the use of a simple t‑test analysis minimizes the risk of complex analytical errors or flexibility that might produce a fragile result.
---
0.93
The reported effect size (ηp^2 = .59) is exceptionally large, and the associated p-value and F-statistic are also extreme, indicating a very strong and statistically robust finding. Although social psychology can have lower replication rates, the high statistical power from the large sample (N=240) and the sheer magnitude of the effect make it highly probable that this core result would replicate successfully. The finding is based on a controlled behavioral game, which often produces more stable results than studies relying on subtle manipulations."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
Word-order rules impose major constraints on linguistic behavior. For example, adjectives appear before nouns in English, and after nouns in French. This means that constraints on word order must be language-specific properties upheld on-line by the language system. Despite the importance of these rules, little is known about how they operate. We report an influence of word order on the activation of phonological representations. Participants were presented with colored objects and asked to name either the colors or the objects; the phonological similarity between the object and color names was manipulated. French speakers showed a phonological congruency effect in color naming, but not in object naming. English participants yielded the opposite pattern: a phonological effect in object naming, but not in color naming. Differences in the typical order of nouns and adjectives in French and English provide a plausible account for this cross-linguistic contrast. More generally, these results provide direct evidence for the operation of word-order constraints during language production.

While the reported p-value is strong and the effect size is very large, these results come from an extremely small sample (N=15). Small-N studies can produce unstable estimates and are prone to effect-size inflation, making the finding less trustworthy. The simple analysis and controlled experimental design are positive factors, but the low sample size significantly reduces confidence in a successful replication.

0.20
The primary reason for the low replication prediction is the extremely small sample size (N=15), which provides very low statistical power and leads to unstable estimates. While the reported effect size is huge (d=1.71) and the p-value is low, such large effects found in tiny samples are often substantially overestimated and shrink dramatically in higher-powered replications. This combination of a very small sample and a massive effect size is a classic indicator of an unreliable result that is unlikely to replicate successfully.

0.35
The primary reason for the low replication probability is the extremely small sample size (N=15), which provides very weak evidence despite the low p-value. This small sample also means the exceptionally large effect size (d=1.71) is likely a substantial overestimation of the true effect. A well-powered, independent replication would almost certainly find a much smaller effect, which may not be statistically significant.

This study's primary weakness is its extremely small sample size (N=15), which provides low statistical power and increases the chance of finding a spuriously large effect. While the reported p-value is low (<.007), the massive effect size (d=1.71) is likely an overestimation due to sampling error, a phenomenon known as the ""winner's curse."" A well-powered replication would almost certainly find a much smaller effect, which may not be statistically significant.

The primary reason for the low prediction is the extremely small sample size (N=15), which makes the finding highly susceptible to sampling error. While the p-value is low, the enormous effect size (d=1.71) is likely an overestimation and a classic example of the ""winner's curse"" common in underpowered studies. A larger, more precise replication would almost certainly find a much smaller effect that may no longer be statistically significant."

This prediction is low primarily because studies on ovulatory shifts in mate preference have a well-documented history of failing to replicate in large-scale, pre-registered studies. While the reported p-value (p=0.008) is significant and the sample size is moderate, the small-to-medium effect size for a complex three-way interaction is a major warning sign. The combination of a controversial topic known for non-replication and a relatively small effect makes a successful independent replication highly unlikely.

0.15
While the p-value of 0.008 and the sample size of 208 appear adequate, the probability of replication is very low due to the study's subject matter and design. Research on menstrual cycle effects on psychological preferences has a notoriously poor replication record, and the key finding is a complex interaction with a small effect size (f = 0.19). These factors suggest the original result is likely fragile and may not hold up under the scrutiny of an independent replication attempt.

0.22
This prediction is low primarily because the study investigates a complex interaction effect related to the ovulatory shift hypothesis, a domain in evolutionary psychology with a poor track record of successful replication. The reported effect size is small (f = 0.19) and the p-value (p = .008) is not sufficiently compelling to overcome the high prior odds against such a nuanced finding being robust. These factors suggest the original result may have been statistically fragile and is unlikely to be reproduced in an independent study.

0.25
While the p-value of 0.008 and sample size of 208 are decent, the study's likelihood of replication is low due to its small effect size (f=0.19) and complex interaction-based hypothesis. More importantly, research on mating preference shifts across the menstrual cycle is a subfield known for major replication failures in subsequent large-scale studies. The fragility of the effect and the poor track record of the specific research area substantially lower the confidence in this finding.

The reported p-value of .008 and sample size of 208 appear adequate at first glance, but other factors suggest low replicability. The subfield of evolutionary psychology concerning ovulatory shifts has a well-documented history of replication failures. Furthermore, the core finding is a complex interaction effect, which is inherently less robust and requires more statistical power to detect reliably than a simple main effect, especially given the observed small-to-medium effect size.

0.20
Despite a statistically significant p-value (p=0.008) and a decent sample size for its time, the replication likelihood is low. This is primarily because the hypothesis involves ovulatory shifts in mate preference, a subfield of evolutionary psychology with a well-documented history of failed replications in large-scale, pre-registered studies. Furthermore, the reported small-to-medium effect size (f=0.19) and the complexity of the interaction effect make the finding less likely to be robust across different samples.
---
0.15
The prediction is low despite a significant p-value because the study tests an ovulatory shift hypothesis, a research area in evolutionary social psychology with a well-documented history of failed replications. The finding hinges on a complex interaction effect, which is statistically less robust than a main effect and harder to replicate reliably. Although the sample size is moderate, these factors, combined with the small-to-medium effect size, suggest the original result is unlikely to be reproduced in an independent study.
---
0.25
This prediction is low because the study investigates an ovulatory shift hypothesis, a specific area within evolutionary psychology that has a well-documented history of replication failures. While the p-value is significant (p=0.008), the small-to-medium effect size (f=0.19) for a complex interaction effect is difficult to replicate without a very large sample. The study's core theoretical claim is therefore unlikely to be supported in a direct, pre-registered replication attempt.
---
0.25
This prediction is low primarily because the subfield of evolutionary psychology focusing on ovulatory cycle shifts has a very poor replication record. The study tests a complex interaction, and the reported effect size is small-to-medium (f = 0.19) with a p-value (p = .008) that is not exceptionally low, increasing the chance that the original finding is not robust. While the sample size is reasonable, these other factors strongly suggest a low probability of successful replication."

This study's reported effect size is very large (ηp² = 0.522) and the p‑value is highly significant (p ≈ .002), which are strong positive indicators for replicability. However, the extremely small sample size (N=14) is a major concern, as it leads to unstable estimates that may be inflated and highly dependent on the specific participants tested. The strong statistical signal slightly outweighs the risk from the small sample, but the low power and potential for error temper the prediction.
---
0.35
While the reported p-value is very low and the effect size is extremely large, the study's foundation is weak due to the very small sample size (N=14). Small samples can produce statistically significant results by chance and tend to substantially inflate effect size estimates. Consequently, a replication attempt would likely find a much smaller true effect, which may not be statistically significant, making a successful replication less probable.
---
0.35
The reported effect size is extremely large and the p-value is very low, but these results are derived from a very small sample size of 14 participants. Such small samples produce highly unstable estimates and are prone to exaggerating effect sizes, a phenomenon known as the ""winner's curse."" Therefore, despite the strong headline statistics, the finding is unlikely to replicate because the original result was likely inflated by sampling error.
---
0.35
The primary concern is the extremely small sample size (N=14), which makes the finding highly susceptible to the “winner’s curse,” where the reported large effect size (_p^2 = 0.522) is likely a massive overestimate. Although the p-value is very low (prep = .99 corresponds to p ≈ .002) and it's a controlled cognitive experiment, the tiny sample provides a very unstable evidence base, casting significant doubt on the robustness of the effect.
---
0.35
The primary concern for replication is the extremely small sample size (N=14), which creates a high risk of an inflated effect size and a spurious result (a Type I error). Although the reported p-value is very low (implied p ≈ .002) and the effect size is massive (ηp² = 0.522), such strong results from a tiny sample are often not robust. A well-powered replication would almost certainly find a smaller effect, which may not be statistically significant."

The prediction is low primarily due to the very small sample size (N=43), which provides low statistical power and leads to unstable, likely inflated, effect estimates.

The primary reason for the low replication probability is the very small sample size (N=43) for a between-subjects design, which suggests the study was severely underpowered. While the reported effect size is large (__p^2 = .16) and the p-value is significant, such results from small samples are often inflated and unstable. Additionally, this type of embodied cognition/social priming research has a history of high-profile replication failures.

This prediction is low primarily due to the very small sample size (N=43) for a between-subjects experiment, which produces unstable estimates and low statistical power. Although the reported p-value is strong and the effect size is large, such large effects from subtle priming manipulations in small-N studies are often highly inflated and unlikely to replicate. Furthermore, social priming research is a subfield known for facing significant replication challenges.
---
0.15
The prediction is low due to a convergence of risk factors, most notably the very small sample size (N=43) for a between-subjects design, which makes the finding susceptible to being a false positive and likely inflates the reported large effect size. Furthermore, this is a social psychology priming study, a paradigm with a well-documented history of low replication rates, and the specific ""moral cleansing"" effect has famously failed to replicate in subsequent large-scale efforts."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
Extremal edges (EEs) are projections of viewpoint-specific horizons of self-occlusion on smooth convex surfaces. An ecological analysis of viewpoint constraints suggests that an EE surface is likely to be closer to the observer than the non-EE surface on the other side of the edge. In two experiments, one using shading gradients and the other using texture gradients, we demonstrated that EEs operate as strong cues to relative depth perception and figure-ground organization. Image regions with an EE along the shared border were overwhelmingly perceived as closer than either flat or equally convex surfaces without an EE along that border. A further demonstration suggests that EEs are more powerful than classical figure-ground cues, including even the joint effects of small size, convexity, and surroundedness.

- Sample size: 8

The prediction is high despite the extremely small sample size due to several converging factors. The study reports a massive effect size (d=1.573) and a highly significant p‑value (<.001), which are strong predictors of replicability. Furthermore, the research is in cognitive perception, a subfield with a good replication track record, and the simple t‑test analysis is less prone to error than more complex models. While the tiny sample increases the risk of a chance finding, the sheer magnitude of the reported effect suggests it is robust and likely to be found again.
---
0.88
The primary reason for this high estimate is the exceptionally large effect size (d = 1.573) paired with a highly significant p-value, suggesting a robust and easily detectable phenomenon. While the sample size is very small (N=8), such a large effect can be reliably found even in small-N designs, which are common in psychophysics and basic perception research. The straightforward analysis and the nature of the topic—a fundamental aspect of visual perception—further increase the probability that the finding is not a statistical artifact and would replicate successfully.

0.82
The reported evidence is exceptionally strong (p<.001, d=1.573), and the study concerns a basic perceptual phenomenon, a subfield where effects are often robust and reliable. While the extremely small sample size (N=8) is a major concern that increases the risk of an inflated effect size estimate, the sheer magnitude of the reported effect makes it very likely that a well-powered replication would also find a significant result. The simple t-test analysis also adds to this confidence by limiting analytical flexibility.

This study reports a very large effect size (d=1.573) and a highly significant p-value (<.001), both of which are strong predictors of replication success. While the extremely small sample size (N=8) is a major concern and increases the risk of effect size overestimation, the sheer magnitude of the reported effect suggests it is robust. The study’s focus on a basic cognitive perception phenomenon with a simple t-test analysis further increases the likelihood that the finding is real and replicable.

This study has a very high probability of replication. The primary positive indicator is the extremely large effect size (d = 1.573) and correspondingly low p-value, which suggest a powerful and easily detectable phenomenon. While the sample size of 8 is very small and typically a major red flag, such large effects in cognitive perception research are often robust and less dependent on individual differences, making them likely to replicate even with small samples."

The reported effect size is medium-to-large (r = -0.43) and the sample size of 70 units (likely countries) is substantial for a cross-national study, implying a very low p-value. The straightforward correlational analysis and the first author's high citation count, suggesting significant expertise, further increase confidence. These factors combined—a strong and highly significant effect found using a robust design—point to a high likelihood of successful replication.

This study has a high probability of replication due to its large effect size (r = -0.43) and a very robust sample size (N=70) for a country-level analysis, which yields a highly significant p-value.

This prediction is low primarily due to the combination of a small sample size (N=53) and a p-value reported as just under the conventional threshold of .05. This pattern suggests the finding may not be robust, as underpowered studies can produce inflated and unstable effect estimates that are less likely to replicate. While the analysis is simple, the small-to-moderate effect size would require a substantially larger sample to establish a confident and replicable result.

0.35
This prediction is low primarily due to the small sample size (N=53) combined with a p-value that is just below the .05 threshold of significance. Such studies are often underpowered, meaning a successful result may be due to chance, and the reported effect size is likely an overestimation (the ""winner's curse""). The combination of low power and a marginal p-value in a subfield like social cognition, which has had mixed replication results, suggests a low probability of successful replication.
---
0.35
The primary concerns are the small sample size (N=53) and resulting low statistical power, which makes the effect size estimate of r=-.31 likely inflated and less stable. While the reported p-value is <.05, it is not overwhelmingly strong evidence, and novel findings in this subfield linking abstract concepts to cognition have historically faced replication challenges. The simple correlational analysis is a positive factor, but it is unlikely to outweigh the risk from an underpowered original study.

0.32
This prediction is low primarily due to the small sample size (N=53), which provides low statistical power for detecting a modest effect size (r=-.31). The reported p-value of <.05, combined with the small sample, increases the likelihood that the original result was a false positive or an inflated estimate. Furthermore, surprising findings linking personality traits to basic cognitive processes have historically shown mixed replication success.

The primary concerns are the small sample size (N=53) and the reported p-value just meeting the threshold for significance (p < .05). Such findings are statistically fragile, have wider confidence intervals, and are more likely to be overestimates of the true effect, a phenomenon known as the ""winner's curse."" Although the reported effect size (r = -.31) is moderate, its discovery in a small sample from a subfield (social psychology) with historically lower replication rates suggests a low probability of successful replication."

Subjects performed a spatial compatibility task during which they had to notice rare prospective memory cues. Such cues were overlooked more often on conflict trials than on nonconflict trials, a result indicating that shielding of the current goal and inhibition of distractors were increased on the current trial when it involved a response conflict. Thus, evidence for enhanced recruitment of control following conflict may partly reflect aftereffects of goal shielding on the conflict trial itself.

This prediction is high due to the combination of a large effect size (ηp² = .14) and a p-value well below the standard threshold (p ≈ .017, calculated from the F-statistic). Although the sample size of 40 is moderate, it is sufficient for the powerful within-subjects design used to detect such a large effect. The study’s focus on a core, robust phenomenon in cognitive psychology further increases the likelihood of a successful replication.
---
0.85
The prediction is high primarily due to the reported large effect size (partial η² = .14), which suggests a robust finding that should be readily detectable in a new sample. This confidence is further supported by a significant p‑value (calculated from the F‑statistic to be p ≈ .017) and an adequate sample size (N=40) for a standard within‑subjects cognitive paradigm. These strong statistical signals in a well‑controlled experimental context point to a high probability of successful replication.
---
0.85
The prediction is high due to the combination of a very large reported effect size (ηp² = .14) and a p‑value well below the standard .05 threshold (the F‑statistic corresponds to p ≈ .017). Although the sample size of 40 is moderate, it is adequate for this type of within‑subjects cognitive experiment and provides high statistical power for an effect of this magnitude. These factors suggest a robust finding that is likely to replicate successfully.
---
0.70
The reported effect size (ηp^2 = .14) is large, which is a strong predictor of replication success, and the sample size (N=40) is adequate for a within-subjects cognitive study. The primary source of uncertainty is the p‑value (p≈.017, calculated from the F‑statistic), which is significant but not overwhelmingly small, suggesting the effect size estimate could be imprecise. Nevertheless, the large magnitude of the effect in a standard cognitive task makes a successful replication probable.
---
0.82
This study has a high probability of replication due to its large reported effect size (ηp^2 = .14) and a p-value (p ≈ .017, inferred from the F‑statistic) that is comfortably below the conventional significance threshold. The use of a within‑subjects design increases statistical power, which helps offset the modest sample size. While cognitive effects can be sensitive to procedural details, the strength of this reported effect suggests it is robust."

This study has a high probability of replication due to its very strong statistical evidence, including a low p-value (p<.01) and a large effect size (ηp² = .23). The use of a standard ANOVA and a well-controlled visual search paradigm from cognitive psychology also increases the likelihood of success. The primary weakness is the small sample size, which can produce unstable estimates, but the sheer strength of the reported signal suggests a genuine underlying effect that would likely be found again.
---

The prediction is high due to the very large reported effect size (ηp² = .23) and a correspondingly strong test statistic, which suggests a robust finding. Although the sample size is modest and could lead to an overestimation of the effect, the study investigates a classic, plausible attentional bias within a standard cognitive paradigm that is often found to be reliable. Therefore, a successful replication is quite likely.
---
0.90
The prediction is high due to the combination of a very strong p-value (p<.01) and a large reported effect size (ηp² = .23). While the sample size is modest, the large effect suggests the study was well-powered and that the phenomenon is robust enough to be detected in a replication attempt. The use of a standard analysis and a theoretically grounded hypothesis (evolutionary threat detection) further increases confidence in the finding's replicability.
---
0.85
The prediction is high due to a strong statistical result (p<.01, large effect size of ηp²=.23) and a simple experimental design. Most importantly, the abstract reports that the finding was consistent across three separate experiments, which strongly suggests the effect is robust. While the sample size for any single experiment is modest, this internal replication and the strength of the reported effect make a successful independent replication very likely.
---
0.82
This prediction is high due to the combination of a very strong p-value (p<.01 with an F-statistic of 13.42) and a large effect size (ηp² = .23), which together suggest a robust finding. While the sample size is relatively small, the effect is so large that it would likely be detected again in a replication attempt. The study also uses a standard cognitive paradigm (visual search task) with a straightforward analysis (ANOVA), which generally increases confidence in the result."

Participants then learned that they would receive for each previously seen picture from one of the two categories (either birds or flowers). To determine the endowed category, respondents flipped a coin. Next, we asked them to estimate the number of pictures in each category. As predicted, participants were more likely to underestimate the number of flower pictures relative to bird pictures when they expected payment for flower pictures than when they expected payment for bird pictures. In contrast, they were more likely to underestimate the number of bird pictures relative to flower pictures when they expected payment for bird pictures than when they expected payment for flower pictures. Our results implicate a judgment process at the stimulus-retrieval stage, rather than at the encoding stage, because the value difference between the stimulus categories was induced randomly only after the stimuli were presented.

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
If people use the value of a class of stimuli heuristically to infer the frequency of the stimuli, they will assess more valuable stimulus classes as being less frequent even when value is not diagnostic of frequency.

This prediction is relatively low due to the combination of a small sample size (N=56) and a p-value (p=.037) that is just below the conventional threshold for significance. Studies with these characteristics are often underpowered, increasing the risk that the original finding was a false positive or that the reported medium effect size is an overestimation. While the analysis is straightforward, the weak statistical evidence makes the result less likely to be robust and replicable.

The prediction is low primarily due to the combination of a small sample size (N=56) and a p-value (p=0.037) that is just below the conventional significance threshold. This combination suggests the original result is statistically fragile and may be an overestimation of the true effect, increasing the risk of a non-significant finding in a replication. While the reported effect size is moderate and the analysis is simple, the weak statistical evidence from the original study makes successful replication less likely.

The primary concerns for this study's replicability are its small sample size (N=56) and a p-value (p=.037) that is only narrowly significant. This combination suggests the result may be statistically fragile, with a high likelihood of being a false positive or having an inflated effect size. While the use of a simple Chi-squared test is a positive factor that limits analytical flexibility, the weak statistical evidence is the more dominant signal, casting significant doubt on whether an independent replication would find a significant effect.

The prediction is low due to the combination of a small sample size (N=56) and a p-value (p=0.037) that is just below the conventional threshold for statistical significance. This pattern suggests the original study was underpowered, making the result susceptible to being a false positive or a highly inflated effect size estimate. While the experimental design is simple, these statistical weaknesses are strong predictors of replication failure.

This study has a very high risk of replication failure. The extremely small sample size (N=18) makes the results highly susceptible to sampling error, and the reported effect size (η² = .7) is unrealistically large for this type of research, strongly suggesting inflation. Although the p-value is nominally strong, such a result is difficult to trust when combined with a tiny sample, a hallmark of findings that have not held up to replication.

0.75
This prediction is based on the strong statistical evidence from a powerful within‑subjects design; the reported F‑statistic corresponds to a p‑value of approximately .007, which is compelling. However, the very small sample size (N=18) is a major concern, as it increases the risk that the large observed effect is an overestimate and may not be as robust in a new sample. The claim of three successful experiments provides some reassurance, but the small N tempers the overall confidence in replicability.

The primary reason for this low prediction is the extremely small sample size (N=18), which makes the result highly susceptible to random error and likely to be an overestimate of the true effect. Although the reported p-value is strong, the very large effect size is inconsistent with the F-statistic, suggesting a potential reporting error that further undermines confidence. While the cognitive mechanism is plausible, such small-sample findings often fail to replicate in larger, more definitive studies.

The primary reason for this low prediction is the extremely small sample size (N=18). While the reported p-value is low and the effect size is very large (η²=.7), such results from small samples are often statistically unstable and suffer from effect size inflation (the ""winner's curse""). An independent replication, even if well-powered, would likely find a much smaller effect, making a statistically significant result difficult to achieve.

This study's primary weakness is its extremely small sample size (N=18), which makes the results highly susceptible to sampling error and instability. While the reported p-value is low and the effect size is very large, such findings in underpowered studies are often significantly inflated (the ""winner's curse"") and fail to replicate. The use of an outdated statistical metric (`prep`) also suggests the study was conducted in an era with research practices now known to produce less reliable findings."
