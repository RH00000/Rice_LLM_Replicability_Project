Some subfields—such as social or developmental psychology—have historically shown lower replication rates compared to others like clinical or personality psychology, though individual study quality still matters.",0.4,0.35,0.35,0.65,0.4,0.43,"0.40
The probability is estimated to be low primarily due to the combination of a small effective sample size (implied by the F‑statistic's degrees of freedom) and a p‑value (p=.02) that is close to the significance threshold. While the reported effect size is large and the author is highly cited, such large effects in small‑N studies are often inflated, suggesting the original finding may be an unstable overestimation that is difficult to replicate.
---
0.35
The primary reason for the low predicted replication success is the extremely small sample size, evidenced by the low denominator degrees of freedom (df = 13). This implies the study had very low statistical power, making the result less reliable. While the reported effect size is large, such large effects in underpowered studies are often substantial overestimates, and the p-value of 0.02 is not strong enough to overcome the concern of a potential false positive.
---
0.35
The reported effect size is very large, which is a positive sign for replication. However, this is undermined by a small sample size (N=24) and a p-value of 0.02, which is close to the significance threshold and associated with lower replicability. The most concerning factor is the denominator degrees of freedom (13), which is unusually low for a sample of 24 and suggests low statistical power, raising the possibility that the large effect is an overestimation.
---
0.65
The prediction is driven by a trade-off between a very large effect size (ηp² = 0.354) and weak statistical evidence. The study's p-value (0.02) is not highly convincing, and the sample size is very small (implied N=14 from the degrees of freedom), which are strong negative predictors of replication success. However, the immense effect was found in a well-controlled cognitive paradigm by a highly-cited author, suggesting the phenomenon is likely robust enough to be detected in a replication.
---
0.40
The primary concerns for replication are the very small sample size (N=24) and the associated low degrees of freedom (df=13), which undermine the stability of the result. While the reported effect size is large, such effects found in small samples are often inflated, and the p-value of 0.02 is close to the significance threshold, a range known for lower replicability. Although the author is well-cited and the cognitive subfield has a strong replication history, these statistical weaknesses are significant risk factors."

The prediction is high due to very strong statistical evidence, including a low p-value (<0.005) and a large effect size (ηp² = .374), within a powerful repeated-measures cognitive paradigm. While the sample size (N=24) is small, the study's programmatic nature—a series of six experiments systematically manipulating the conditions—lends significant confidence that the reported effect is reliable. The authors appear to have isolated the specific conditions under which the phenomenon occurs, making it more likely to be replicated.

The prediction is high due to the exceptionally large reported effect size (ηp² = .374) and strong statistical evidence (p < .005). While the sample size is small, the use of a powerful within‑subjects design (RM ANOVA) is appropriate for this cognitive psychology paradigm where effects are often robust. The programmatic series of experiments described in the abstract further suggests a well‑understood phenomenon, increasing confidence in the finding's stability.

The prediction is moderately high due to the very strong statistical evidence, including a low p‑value (<0.005) and a very large effect size (ηp² = .374). While the small sample size (N=24) is a significant risk factor for effect size inflation, the strength of the signal and the programmatic series of experiments described in the abstract suggest the finding is robust. The within-subjects design (RM ANOVA) also increases statistical power, making a successful replication more likely.
---
0.88
This prediction is high primarily due to the extremely large reported effect size (__p^2 = .374) and the very strong p-value (<0.005). Although the sample size (N=24) is small, the study uses a powerful within-subjects design which is common for this type of cognitive research and can reliably detect large effects. The systematic nature of the experiments, which progressively isolate the phenomenon while ruling out confounds, suggests a robust finding that is likely to replicate successfully.
---
0.85
The prediction is high due to the very strong statistical evidence, including a p-value well below 0.01 and a very large effect size (ηp² = .374). Such a large effect, found in a within-subjects cognitive psychology paradigm, is likely to be robust and detectable even in a replication study. While the sample size of 24 is a limitation, the sheer magnitude of the reported effect significantly increases the probability of successful replication."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
Although many accounts of task switching emphasize the importance of working memory as a substantial source of the switch cost, there is a lack of evidence demonstrating that task switching actually places additional demands on working memory. The present study addressed this issue by implementing task switching in continuous complex span tasks with strictly controlled time parameters. A series of 4 experiments demonstrate that recall performance decreased as a function of the number of task switches and that the concurrent load of item maintenance had no influence on task switching. These results indicate that task switching induces a cost on working memory functioning. Implications for theories of task switching, working memory, and resource sharing are addressed.

Some subfields—such as social or developmental psychology—have historically shown lower replication rates compared to others like clinical or personality psychology, though individual study quality still matters.",0.4,0.75,0.35,0.42,0.35,0.454,"0.40
This study’s small sample size (N=25) and p-value just under the significance threshold (p≈0.03 from the F-statistic) are strong risk factors for non-replication. While the reported effect size is large (ηp²=0.181), it is likely an overestimation due to the small sample, a phenomenon known as the ""winner's curse."" The presence of a series of four experiments is a positive indicator for the overall phenomenon, but the specific metrics provided for this key test suggest a moderate-to-low probability of successful replication.
---
0.75
The prediction is moderately high due to the large reported effect size (ηp² = 0.181) and, most importantly, the fact that the authors demonstrated the finding across a series of four experiments. This strong signal of internal replication helps to mitigate concerns arising from the small sample size (N=25) and the “just significant” p‑value. The within‑subjects design also lends power to the study despite the small number of participants.
---
0.35
This study has a low probability of replication success primarily due to its small sample size (N=25) and a p-value very close to the 0.05 significance threshold. These factors suggest the study had low statistical power, and the large reported effect size is likely an overestimation that would regress to the mean in a new sample. The use of a complex analysis (MANOVA) further increases the risk of non-replication due to potential flexibility in the analysis pipeline.
---
0.42
The prediction is below 50% primarily due to the combination of a very small sample size (N=25) and a p‑value that is close to the significance threshold of .05. This pairing suggests a high likelihood of effect size inflation and a greater chance that the original result was a false positive. While the reported effect size is large and the study is in cognitive psychology (a field with a higher replication rate), these factors are insufficient to overcome the weak statistical evidence.
---
0.35
The primary concerns for replication are the small sample size (N=25) and the p-value being just below the conventional significance threshold. Small, underpowered studies are more susceptible to sampling error, which can produce inflated effect sizes (like the large ηp² reported here) and findings that are not robust. Although a series of experiments is a positive sign, the weak statistical evidence for this specific result makes a successful replication less likely."

This study's large sample size and highly significant p-value (<0.001) are strong positive predictors of replication success. However, the effect size is small-to-medium (ηp² = 0.052), and the authors label the core finding as ""very surprising,"" a factor that often indicates lower robustness.

This intermixed-blocked effect may be an example of the superiority of spaced over massed practice; in the intermixed, but not the blocked exposure regime, each presentation of a given stimulus (e.g., AX) is separated from the next by the presentation of its partner (BX). Two experiments with human participants replicated the intermixed-blocked effect and showed that the effect was not due to the spacing of exposure trials. A mechanism for the intermixed-blocked effect is proposed, which combines theories from associative learning and memory.

Key details:
- Sample size: 32
- Analysis type (e.g. rm ANOVA, mixed ANOVA, regression, t‑test): RM ANOVA
- Test statistic: F(1,31) = 8.38
- Reported p‑value: X
- Effect size (e.g. Cohen’s d, r): dz = 0.51
- First author’s citation count: 1387
- Subfield: Cognitive, Social

Note:
Some subfields—such as social or developmental psychology—have historically shown lower replication rates compared to others like clinical or personality psychology, though individual study quality still matters.",0.78,0.72,0.78,0.72,0.85,0.77,"0.78
The prediction is supported by a strong test statistic (F(1,31)=8.38, implying p < .01) and a solid medium effect size (dz = 0.51). Although the sample size of 32 is modest, the statistical power of the within-subjects design helps mitigate this concern. The fact that the study replicates a phenomenon already described as ""robust"" in the cognitive subfield further increases confidence in its replicability.
---
0.72
This prediction is moderately high due to strong statistical evidence, including a medium effect size (dz = 0.51) and a significant test statistic (F(1,31) = 8.38) that corresponds to a low p‑value. The study also aims to replicate an effect described as robust in prior literature, which increases confidence in the finding. However, the small sample size (N=32) is a notable weakness that introduces uncertainty and slightly lowers the predicted probability of replication.
---
0.78
The prediction is high due to the strong F‑statistic, which implies a p‑value well below .01, and a medium effect size (dz = 0.51). These metrics are strong predictors of replicability, and the within‑subjects design has good statistical power even with a modest sample size of 32. The phenomenon is from cognitive psychology, a subfield with a comparatively strong replication record for core findings.
---
0.72
The study reports a strong p-value (p≈.007, inferred from the F‑statistic) and a plausible medium effect size within a powerful repeated-measures design. Although the sample size of 32 is a notable limitation and could lead to an overestimated effect, this is counterbalanced by the fact that the study investigates a phenomenon described as ""robust."" Therefore, a direct replication is reasonably likely to succeed.
---
0.85
The study reports a plausible medium effect size (dz = 0.51) with a p‑value well below the standard .05 threshold (inferred from the F‑statistic). While the sample size is small, the powerful within-subjects design (RM ANOVA) provides adequate statistical power to detect this effect. The study’s focus on a core cognitive phenomenon, described as robust, further increases the likelihood of a successful replication."

0.78
The very low p-value (0.002) and large effect size (dz = 0.72) provide strong evidence for the reported phenomenon. Although the small sample size (N=24) is a significant concern and suggests the effect size might be overestimated, the finding is in cognitive psychology—a field known for robust effects—making replication probable.

0.78
The reported p-value is very low (0.002) and the effect size is large (dz=0.724), both of which strongly predict a successful replication. Although the small sample size of 24 is a significant weakness that increases the risk of an overestimated effect, the finding’s statistical strength and the analysis’s simplicity (a dependent t-test) suggest the effect is robust.
---
0.72
The prediction is driven primarily by the strong statistical evidence, including a low p‑value (0.002) and a medium‑to‑large effect size (dz = 0.72), which are both strong predictors of replication success. However, confidence is substantially tempered by the small sample size (N=24), which increases the risk that the observed effect is an overestimate. The use of a simple, within-subjects design common in cognitive psychology provides some additional confidence in the robustness of the finding.
---
0.75
The prediction is moderately high due to the very low p-value (p=0.002) and large effect size, which strongly suggest a real effect is present. While the small sample size (N=24) is a notable weakness and may indicate the reported effect size is inflated, the effect is unlikely to be entirely spurious. Confidence is further increased by the simple analysis and the use of a standard, well-understood paradigm from cognitive psychology."

This study has a very high probability of replication due to the extremely large effect size (d = 1.02) and correspondingly high t-statistic. The sample size of 100 is quite adequate for a within-subjects design with such a strong signal, and the simple t-test analysis minimizes the potential for complex, unreplicable statistical modeling. Furthermore, the underlying phenomena (e.g., word-length effect) are canonical and robust findings in cognitive psychology.

0.95
This prediction is based on several strong indicators of replicability. The study reports a very large effect size (d = 1.02) with a highly significant p-value (inferred from the large t-statistic), which is much more likely to replicate than a small, marginal effect. Furthermore, the analysis is a simple t-test with a solid sample size (N=100), reducing concerns about analytical flexibility or low statistical power that can undermine replicability.

0.92
The prediction is high due to the combination of an extremely large effect size (d = 1.02) and a highly significant test statistic (t = 10.18), which implies a p-value far below the reported <.05 threshold. The adequate sample size (N=100) for a simple dependent t-test provides strong statistical power for such a large effect. Furthermore, the study investigates well-established phenomena in cognitive psychology, a field that tends to have higher replication success than others.

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
When expectations and stereotypes are activated at retrieval, they spontaneously create distorted and illusory recollections that are consistent with these expectations. Participants studied doctor (physician)-related and lawyer-related statements that were presented by 2 different people. When informed, on a subsequent source memory test, (i.e., of who presented what) that one of the study sources was actually a doctor and the other source was a lawyer, there was a strong tendency to attribute the test items in a stereotype-consistent manner. In 3 experiments, participants frequently reported recollecting specific details, such as via ""remember"" judgments, to justify their stereotype-consistent but incorrect responses. These experiments rule out explanations involving either the misattribution of strong familiarity or differences in the bias to making remember responses as accounts for the illusory source attributions. Instead, the illusory recollections are consistent with the notion that recollective experience is manufactured from both the information in the memory trace and information in the retrieval environment, such as an individual's expectations, stereotypes, and general knowledge.

The probability of replication is high due to the very strong evidence for the effect, including a very low p-value (p < .001) and an extremely large effect size (ηp² = .32). While the sample size of 39 is a limitation, a true effect of this magnitude is robust and should be easily detected even in a new sample with modest power. The standard experimental design and analysis further support the likelihood of a successful replication.

0.88
The study reports a highly significant p-value (<.001) and a very large effect size (ηp² = .32), which are strong positive indicators for replicability. Although the sample size is small (N=39), which can lead to inflated effect estimates, the sheer magnitude of the reported effect is so large that it is very likely to be detected again in a replication attempt. The finding itself, a stereotype-based memory error, is also a well-established phenomenon in cognitive and social psychology.

The extremely low p-value (p<.001) and very large effect size (ηp² = .32) are strong positive predictors of successful replication. Although the sample size is small (N=39), achieving such a powerful statistical result with a limited sample suggests the underlying phenomenon is quite robust and easily detectable. The use of a standard ANOVA and the fact that the effect was demonstrated across three experiments in the original paper further increase confidence in its replicability.

The very low p-value (<.001) and large effect size (ηp^2 = .32) are strong indicators of a robust and replicable effect. While the sample size (n=39) is small, the sheer strength of the statistical evidence suggests the finding is not a chance occurrence. Furthermore, the study investigates a classic phenomenon in cognitive and social psychology, and its standard laboratory-based design should be straightforward to reproduce.

This study has a high likelihood of replication due to its very strong statistical evidence (p<.001 and a large effect size, ηp² = .32), which suggests a robust phenomenon. While the sample size of 39 is a limitation and may have inflated the effect size, the extremely low p-value indicates the finding is unlikely to be a false positive. Furthermore, the study uses a standard analysis (ANOVA) and a controlled laboratory paradigm, which are generally easier to replicate accurately than more complex designs or field studies."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
The authors investigated semantic neighborhood density effects on visual word processing to examine the dynamics of activation and competition among semantic representations. Experiment 1 validated feature-based semantic representations as a basis for computing semantic neighborhood density and suggested that near and distant neighbors have opposite effects on word processing. Experiment 2 confirmed these results: Word processing was slower for dense near neighborhoods and faster for dense distant neighborhoods. Analysis of a computational model showed that attractor dynamics can produce this pattern of neighborhood effects. The authors argue for reconsideration of traditional models of neighborhood effects in terms of attractor dynamics, which allow both inhibitory and facilitative effects to emerge.

This study has conflicting indicators, but the evidence for replicability is moderately strong. The small sample size (N=22) is a significant weakness, but it is counterbalanced by the powerful within‑subjects design, a very strong p‑value (<.001), and an exceptionally large effect size (__p^2 = .452). While the reported effect size is likely inflated due to the small sample, the signal is so strong that a well‑powered replication would be very likely to find a significant effect in the same direction.

The study reports a highly significant p-value (<.001) and a very large effect size (ηp² = .452), which on their own would suggest a high probability of replication. However, these results stem from a very small sample (N=22), which can produce inflated and unstable effect size estimates. While a true effect is likely present, its magnitude is probably overestimated, introducing moderate uncertainty for a successful replication.

0.72
The extremely low p-value (p < .001) and very large effect size (ηp² = .452) are strong predictors of a successful replication. However, the very small sample size (N=22) is a major weakness, raising the possibility that this large effect is an overestimation due to sampling error. The study's use of a standard within‑subjects design in cognitive psychology is a positive factor, but the small sample significantly tempers the otherwise strong statistical evidence.

While the study reports a very low p‑value (<.001) and a large effect size (η_p^2 = .452), the extremely small sample size (N=22) is a major concern for replicability. Small samples can yield statistically significant results that are driven by chance, and they tend to inflate the true effect size. Therefore, although the reported signal is strong, confidence is tempered by the high risk that the true effect is substantially smaller.

The very small sample size (N=22) is a significant concern, as results from such studies can be unstable and their effect sizes inflated. However, this weakness is strongly counterbalanced by the extremely low p-value (p<.001) and very large effect size (ηp² = .452), which indicate a robust signal that is likely to be detected again. The fact that the paper reported two experiments with converging results (a form of internal replication) further increases the likelihood of a successful independent replication."

The primary concern is the p-value, which is just below the .05 significance threshold (an F-statistic of 3.13 with these degrees of freedom corresponds to p≈.048), a strong predictor of replication failure. While the reported effect size is moderate, the sample size (N=48) is modest for a mixed ANOVA design seeking to find a specific interaction, suggesting the study may have been underpowered. The combination of a borderline p-value and a small sample for a complex design lowers confidence in the finding's robustness.
---
0.35
The primary reason for this low prediction is the reported p-value, which is just under the .05 threshold and suggests a statistically fragile finding. While the study has a decent reported effect size and the benefits of a controlled laboratory design, the modest sample size of 48 is small for a mixed ANOVA testing an interaction. This combination of a barely-significant p-value and a small sample greatly increases the chance that the original result was a type I error or that the effect size was overestimated, making a successful replication unlikely.
---
0.35
This prediction is low primarily because the reported p-value of <.05 corresponds to a test statistic that is just barely significant, a strong signal of potential p-hacking or low statistical power. This concern is amplified by the relatively small sample size (N=48), which can lead to inflated effect size estimates and spurious findings. While the effect is theoretically plausible within cognitive psychology, the combination of a marginal p-value and a small sample makes a successful replication unlikely.
---
0.35
The primary reason for the low replication probability is the reported p-value being just under the .05 significance threshold (an F-statistic of 3.13 with these degrees of freedom yields p=.048), which is a strong predictor of fragile findings. This concern is amplified by the relatively small sample size for a mixed ANOVA design, suggesting the study was underpowered and the reported medium effect size may be an overestimation. The complex interaction-based finding further increases the risk that the result will not replicate.
---
0.35
The primary concern for replication is the p-value, which at <.05 for an F-statistic of 3.13 is very close to the significance threshold (p≈.048). Such ""just significant"" results, especially from a moderate sample size (N=48), have a lower probability of replicating as the reported medium effect size may be an overestimate. The use of a mixed ANOVA, a relatively complex analysis, can also make findings less robust than those from simpler designs."

The reported p-value is very low (<.001) and the effect size is extremely large (ηp² = 0.55), which strongly suggests a real phenomenon was detected. However, the small sample size (N=36) raises a significant risk that this effect size is inflated, and complex interaction effects can sometimes be fragile. Overall, the sheer magnitude of the reported statistics from a controlled cognitive experiment makes a successful replication likely, even if the resulting effect size is smaller.
---
0.85
This prediction is high due to the exceptionally strong evidence reported, including a very small p‑value and an extremely large effect size (ηp² = 0.55). Although the sample size is modest (N=36), the magnitude of the effect suggests a robust phenomenon that a well-powered replication is very likely to detect. The key finding is an interaction, which can sometimes be fragile, but the strength of the statistical signal here outweighs concerns about the sample size and complexity.
---
0.75
This prediction balances the study's very strong statistical evidence (p < .001, ηp² = 0.55) against its small sample size (N=36). While a small N typically lowers replicability, the massive reported effect size suggests the phenomenon is powerful enough to be detected again, even if the original estimate is inflated. The use of a mixed ANOVA to find a nuanced interaction effect adds some uncertainty, but the strength of the signal points toward a high likelihood of successful replication.

0.88
This study has a very high likelihood of replication due to its extremely low p-value (p < .001) and exceptionally large reported effect size (ηp² = 0.550). Although the sample size is small, the magnitude of the effect is so large that it suggests a robust phenomenon that should be easily detectable in a new sample. The experienced author and cognitive psychology subfield are also positive indicators for success.

The reported p-value (<.001) and very large effect size (ηp² = 0.55) provide strong evidence for a robust phenomenon that should be readily detectable. Although the small sample size (N=36) is a notable weakness and may have inflated the effect size estimate, the sheer magnitude of the signal makes the core finding highly likely to replicate. The study's focus on a controlled cognitive task further increases confidence in its replicability compared to more context‑dependent fields."

Some subfields—such as social or developmental psychology—have historically shown lower replication rates compared to others like clinical or personality psychology, though individual study quality still matters.",0.35,0.35,0.25,0.35,0.35,0.33,"0.35
The reported p-value is extremely close to the significance threshold of 0.05 and appears to result from a one-tailed test, as the corresponding two-tailed p-value would be non-significant (p ≈ 0.056). This, combined with a small effect size (d = 0.198), suggests the finding is not robust and has a high likelihood of being a false positive or an overestimated effect. Although the sample size is reasonable for a within-subjects design, the statistical evidence is too weak to expect a successful replication.
---
0.35
The predicted probability is low due to the combination of a small effect size (d = 0.198) and a p-value (p = 0.028) that is just below the conventional significance threshold. Such marginally significant results for small effects are often statistically underpowered, have a higher chance of being false positives, and are difficult to detect again in a new sample. While the sample size is reasonable for a cognitive experiment, it is not large enough to ensure high confidence in this subtle effect.
---
0.25
The reported p-value of 0.028 is only marginally significant and was likely obtained with a one-tailed test, as the two-tailed p-value would be non-significant (p≈0.057). This statistical fragility, combined with a small effect size (d=0.198), indicates a high chance the result is a false positive or an overestimate of a tiny true effect. Although the analysis is simple and the sample size is adequate, these positive factors are insufficient to overcome the weak statistical evidence for the finding.
---
0.35
The primary drivers for this low prediction are the reported p-value and effect size. A p-value of 0.028 is very close to the conventional 0.05 threshold for statistical significance, and such ""just significant"" results have been shown to replicate less often. Furthermore, the reported effect size (d = 0.198) is small, indicating that even if the effect is real, the study was underpowered to detect it reliably, increasing the chance the original result was a false positive or an overestimation.
---
0.35
The primary drivers for this low estimate are the marginal p‑value (0.028), which is just below the standard threshold for significance, and the small effect size (d = 0.198). Such a combination suggests the original study may have been underpowered and that the finding is not very robust. Furthermore, the reported p-value likely resulted from a one-tailed test, which increases the risk that the original result was a false positive, further decreasing the likelihood of a successful replication."

The primary risk to replicability is the small sample size, which can produce unstable estimates. However, this weakness is substantially offset by the use of a powerful within‑subjects design (RM ANOVA), which is sensitive to effects because it controls for individual differences. Given the extremely low p‑value and the large reported effect size (ηp² = 0.186), the finding is robust and has a high probability of successful replication.
---
0.78
This study has a high likelihood of replication due to its very strong statistical evidence, including a p‑value < .001 and a large effect size (ηp² = 0.186). While the sample size of 39 is a significant weakness that could inflate the effect size estimate, the strength of the signal and the fact that the authors ran two experiments demonstrating the effect suggest it is robust. The well‑established primary author and the cognitive nature of the task further increase confidence in the finding.
---
0.75
The reported p-value is very low (p<.001) and the effect size is large (ηp²=0.186), both of which are strong positive predictors of replicability. However, the small sample size (N=39) is a significant weakness, as results from small samples can be unstable and effect sizes can be inflated. Overall, the strength of the statistical evidence suggests a real effect is present, making a successful replication likely despite the risk associated with the small sample.
---
0.68
The reported p-value is very low (p<.001) and the effect size is large (ηp² = 0.186), which are both strong positive predictors of replication success. However, the small sample size (N=39) is a significant concern, as such studies can produce inflated and less stable effect estimates. The high author citation count and standard analysis (RM ANOVA) are modest positives, but the risk posed by the small sample tempers the overall prediction.

This study has a high likelihood of replication due to its very low p‑value (<.001) and large effect size (ηp² = 0.186), which suggest a robust finding. While the sample size of 39 is small and risks effect size inflation, the strength of the statistical evidence is compelling. Furthermore, the use of a standard repeated-measures ANOVA in a cognitive-style experiment points towards a reliable, less context-dependent effect."

This study has a very high probability of replication due to its strong statistical evidence, including a very low p‑value (<.001) and a large effect size (ηp² = .31). The study uses a standard within‑subjects experimental design from cognitive psychology, a subfield with a good track record for replicability. Although the sample size is relatively small, the combination of other strong indicators suggests the effect is robust and not a statistical artifact.
---
0.92
Confidence in replication is very high due to the combination of a very large effect size (ηp² = .31) and a highly significant p-value (p < .001). Although the sample size (N=32) is relatively small, the use of a powerful within-subjects design (RM ANOVA) and the internal replication of the core finding across three separate experiments suggest a robust effect. This, combined with the study being in a subfield (cognitive psychology) with historically higher replication rates, points toward a successful independent replication.
---
0.91
This prediction for high replicability is primarily driven by the very strong statistical evidence: an extremely low p-value (<.001) and a very large effect size (ηp² = .31). Although the sample size of 32 is modest, the use of a repeated-measures ANOVA design provides good statistical power for detecting such a large, robust effect. The study's focus on a core cognitive psychology phenomenon also suggests the finding is likely to be stable and replicable.
---
0.88
The prediction is high due to the very strong evidence reported in the original study, specifically the very low p-value (<.001) and the large effect size (partial η² = .31). Although the sample size is relatively small (N=32), the strength of this evidence suggests a robust phenomenon that should be readily detectable. The experienced author and the inclusion of three experiments with consistent findings further increase confidence in a successful replication.
---
0.85
The reported p-value is very low (<.001) and the effect size is large (ηp² = .31), which are strong positive indicators for replicability. While the sample size (N=32) is modest, the use of a powerful within-subjects design (RM ANOVA) makes this less of a concern for an effect of this magnitude. The study's focus on a core cognitive psychology paradigm also suggests a well-controlled experimental design, further increasing the likelihood of a successful replication."

A respectable sample size and a theory-driven design within a standard cognitive paradigm are positive indicators. However, the key statistical evidence is weak, as the p‑value is close to the .05 threshold and the effect size (η²=.05) is small. These factors, combined with the finding being a specific interaction effect, are strongly associated with a lower probability of successful replication.
---
0.55
This prediction is based on the combination of a small-to-medium effect size (ηp²=.05) and a p-value that is close to the .05 significance threshold. The study's sample size (N=96) provides only modest statistical power (about 60%) to detect an effect of this magnitude, which means an exact replication has a high chance of failing to find a significant result. While the study is in a core cognitive area with a standard design, the statistical evidence for this specific interaction is not overwhelmingly strong.
---
0.42
The reported p-value is close to the conventional .05 threshold, and the effect size is small-to-medium (η²=.05), two factors strongly associated with lower replication rates. Additionally, the key finding is a specific interaction effect found using a mixed ANOVA, a more complex analysis that may have lower robustness compared to simpler tests of main effects. While the sample size is adequate, these statistical warning signs suggest a less than even chance of a successful replication.
---
0.45
The reported p-value of <.05 is close to the significance threshold (the calculated p-value is approximately .028), and the effect size (ηp² = .05) is small; both factors are associated with lower replication rates. While the sample size of 96 is adequate for a lab study and the author is established, this weak statistical evidence for a specific interaction effect makes a successful replication less likely than not.
---
0.38
The prediction is low primarily because the reported p-value is close to the .05 significance threshold (an F of 4.97 with these degrees of freedom yields p≈.028), and the effect size (η²=.05) is small. Small effects with marginal p-values are difficult to replicate, especially when the key finding is a statistical interaction, which tends to be less robust than a main effect. While the sample size (N=96) is reasonable for cognitive psychology, it is likely underpowered for reliably detecting such a small and nuanced effect."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
It has been claimed that bilingualism enhances inhibitory control, but the available evidence is equivocal. The authors evaluated several possible versions of the inhibition hypothesis by comparing monolinguals and bilinguals with regard to stop signal performance, inhibition of return, and the attentional blink. These three phenomena, it can be argued, tap into different aspects of inhibition. Monolinguals and bilinguals did not differ in stop signal reaction time and thus were comparable in terms of active-inhibitory efficiency. However, bilinguals showed no facilitation from spatial cues, showed a strong inhibition of return effect, and exhibited a more pronounced attentional blink. These results suggest that bilinguals do not differ from monolinguals in terms of active inhibition but have acquired a better ability to maintain action goals and to use them to bias goal-related information. Under some circumstances, this ability may indirectly lead to more pronounced reactive inhibition of irrelevant information.

- Test statistic: F(3, 93) = 5.23

The prediction is low primarily due to the extremely small sample size (N=18), which is inadequate for a between-groups comparison and leads to highly unstable results. While the p-value is strong, this is likely driven by an inflated effect size, a common issue in small samples. The study’s topic is also in a notoriously contentious area of psychology known for mixed findings, further reducing the likelihood of a successful replication.

The predicted likelihood is very low primarily due to the extremely small sample size (N=18), which makes findings unstable and likely to be overestimated. Although the p-value is low, such a result from an underpowered study is a red flag for a false positive or a substantially inflated effect. Furthermore, the F-statistic’s degrees of freedom are mathematically inconsistent with the reported sample size, and the research topic itself (bilingual advantage) is known for replication challenges.

The primary reason for the low replication estimate is the extremely small sample size (N=18), which yields low statistical power and makes findings highly unstable. While the reported p-value is very low (p=.002), such a strong result from a tiny, underpowered sample is a classic signal of an overestimated effect that is unlikely to replicate. The abstract itself notes that evidence in this subfield is ""equivocal,"" further suggesting that findings are often fragile.

The primary reason for the low replication likelihood is the extremely small sample size (N=18), which offers low statistical power and produces unstable estimates. A significant result (p=.002) from such an underpowered study is very likely to represent an inflated effect size that a well-powered replication would fail to detect. This issue is compounded by the study's focus on the bilingual advantage, a subfield known for inconsistent and difficult-to-replicate findings.
---
0.15
The primary reason for this low prediction is the extremely small sample size (N=18), which is severely underpowered for comparing groups and makes the findings highly susceptible to sampling error. Additionally, the reported degrees of freedom on the test statistic (df=93) are mathematically inconsistent with the sample size, suggesting a reporting error that undermines the study's credibility. These factors suggest a very low probability of replication, despite the low p‑value."

The prediction for high replicability is based on the combination of a very strong statistical result (p < .001 and a large F-statistic) and a robust study design. The sample size of 154 is quite good for a within-subjects cognitive experiment, and the implied large effect size suggests the finding is not a statistical artifact. Furthermore, controlled laboratory experiments in cognitive psychology using standard analyses like RM ANOVA tend to have higher replication rates than more complex field studies.

This study has a high probability of successful replication due to several favorable characteristics. The sample size (N=154) is large for a cognitive psychology experiment, and the reported statistical evidence is very strong (p < .001, F(1, 152) = 23.176), which implies a large effect size. The use of a standard, powerful repeated-measures ANOVA design for a well-controlled priming experiment further suggests the finding is robust.
---
0.88
The high replication likelihood is driven by very strong statistical evidence: a p-value < .001 and a large F-statistic (F(1, 152) = 23.18) imply a robust and large effect. This is further supported by a solid sample size for a cognitive lab study and the presence of a second experiment in the paper, which provides internal replication.
---
0.92
The reported p-value is very low (<.001) and the F-statistic implies a large effect size, both of which are strong predictors of replication success. The sample size of 154 is adequate for a repeated-measures ANOVA, and the study's cognitive psychology subfield, involving a controlled lab-based priming task, tends to have higher replication rates. The first author's high citation count further adds modest confidence in the result's robustness.

The study's high likelihood of replication is supported by its very strong statistical evidence, including a low p-value (<.001) and a large F-statistic, which suggests a substantial underlying effect size. The sample size (N=154) is quite good for a lab-based cognitive experiment with a repeated-measures design. While priming effects can sometimes be fragile, the combination of a large effect, strong p-value, and a standard analysis makes this particular finding likely to be robust."

The prediction is high due to the extremely low p-value (<.001) and a very large effect size (d=1.51), which suggest a highly robust finding. While the sample size is small, this is less concerning in a cognitive study with a powerful within-subjects design where such a large effect is readily detectable. The research also builds upon the well-replicated Hebb effect, increasing confidence in the result.

The reported p-value is very small (<.001) and the effect size is extremely large (d=1.51), both of which are strong positive predictors of replicability. Although the small sample size (N=24) is a major concern and suggests the effect size may be inflated, the study investigates a well-established cognitive phenomenon and the statistical evidence is strong enough to suggest the finding is robust. The well-controlled nature of a cognitive lab experiment further increases the probability of a successful replication.

The extremely low p-value (<.001) and very large effect size (d=1.51) strongly suggest a replicable finding, despite the very small sample size. While the small sample might inflate the effect size, the study investigates an extension of the well-established Hebb repetition effect, a robust phenomenon in cognitive psychology. Therefore, a successful replication is highly probable, even if it observes a more modest effect.

The prediction for high replicability is driven by the combination of a very strong p-value (<.001) and an extremely large effect size (d=1.51), which suggests a robust and easily detectable finding. While the sample size (N=24) is small, the magnitude of the effect within a controlled cognitive paradigm makes it very likely to be found again. The fact that the study extends a well-replicated base phenomenon (the Hebb effect) also increases confidence.

Changes in reading processes were assessed by measuring the effect of predictable switches between stimulus categories across trials.

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
Recent evidence suggests that the processes responsible for generating a phonological code from print are flexible in skilled readers. An important goal, therefore, is to identify the conditions that lead to changes in how a phonological code is computed. Five experiments are reported that examine whether phonological processes change as predicted by the pathway control hypothesis when reading aloud words and nonwords. Changes in reading processes were assessed by measuring the effect of predictable switches between stimulus categories across trials. The results of the present experiments are argued to be consistent with the pathway control hypothesis.

Key details:
- Sample size: 16
- Analysis type (e.g. rm ANOVA, mixed ANOVA, regression, t‑test): mixed ANOVA
- Test statistic: F(1, 94) = 2.5
- Reported p‑value: >0.1
- Effect size (e.g. Cohen’s d, r): _^2 = .026
- First author’s citation count: 462
- Subfield: Cognitive, Social

Larger sample sizes generally contribute to more stable and replicable findings, though overall replicability depends on a combination of factors.","# System

The prediction is very low primarily because the original study reported a non-significant result (p > 0.1) for its key statistical test. An independent replication is highly unlikely to find a statistically significant effect (the typical definition of success) when the original study did not. This conclusion is further supported by the very small reported effect size (η² = .026) and the small sample size (N=16), which indicates the original experiment was severely underpowered.

The primary reason for the low replication probability is that the original study reported a statistically non‑significant result (p > 0.1). A replication is highly unlikely to achieve statistical significance (the typical definition of success) when the original study did not. This conclusion is strongly supported by the very small sample size (N=16) and the small effect size (η² = .026), which indicate the experiment was underpowered and the evidence for the effect was weak to begin with.
---
0.12
The reported p-value is >0.1, which indicates the original result was not statistically significant and provides very weak evidence for the effect. This finding, combined with a very small sample size (N=16) and a small effect size (η² = .026), makes a successful replication highly unlikely. The study was severely underpowered to detect such a small effect.
---
0.85
This study reported a non‑significant result (p>0.1) with a small effect size (η² = .026) from a very small sample (N=16). A successful replication would be one that also finds a non‑significant result. Given the weak evidence for an effect in the original paper, it is highly probable that a replication study would similarly fail to find a statistically significant effect.
---
0.15
The original study reported a non-significant result (p > 0.1) with a small effect size, making a significant replication (p < .05) highly improbable. The extremely small sample size (N=16) indicates the study was severely underpowered, producing an unstable estimate that is unlikely to replicate. The authors’ soft conclusion, arguing the results are merely “consistent with” the hypothesis, further signals a weak and unconvincing finding."

The primary risk factors are the small sample size (N=32) and a p-value (p=.03) that is very close to the conventional significance threshold. While the reported effect size is large (ηp² = .143), such estimates are often inflated in small, just-significant studies. This combination suggests a notable chance the original finding was a false positive or an overestimation of the true effect, reducing the likelihood of a successful replication.
---
0.45
This prediction is driven by the combination of a small sample size (N=32) and a p-value (p=0.03) that is significant but worryingly close to the .05 threshold, a known risk factor for replication failure. While the reported effect size is large (ηp² = .143) and the within-subjects cognitive paradigm is typically well-controlled, results from small studies with borderline p-values are often less stable. The large effect may be an overestimation, making a successful replication less certain.
---
0.45
This prediction is driven by the combination of a small sample size (N=32) and a p‑value (p=0.03) that is only barely statistically significant. While the reported effect size is large, such results from small studies are often inflated, and the p-value’s proximity to the .05 threshold suggests the finding may not be robust. The use of a standard cognitive paradigm is a positive sign, but the statistical weakness of the key result reduces confidence in its replicability.
---
0.35
The predicted probability is low due to the combination of a small sample size (N=32) and a p-value (p=0.03) that is close to the .05 significance threshold. This pattern suggests the result is not robust and that the large reported effect size is likely an overestimation due to sampling error. While the author is well-established, these statistical weaknesses, combined with the complexity of the reported interaction, strongly reduce the likelihood of a successful replication.
---
0.42
The reported p-value of 0.03 is very close to the conventional significance threshold, which is a strong indicator of lower replicability. While the reported effect size is large (ηp² = .143) and the cognitive psychology subfield tends to have higher replication rates, the small sample size (N=32) suggests the effect size may be an overestimation. The combination of a fragile p-value and a small sample casts doubt on the robustness of the finding, despite the large point estimate of the effect."

In 2 experiments participants named pictures of common objects with superimposed distractor words. In one naming condition, the pictures and words were presented simultaneously on every trial, and participants produced the target response immediately. In the other naming condition, the presentation of the picture preceded the presentation of the distractor by 1,000 ms, and participants delayed production of their naming response until distractor word presentation. Within each naming condition, the distractor words were either semantic category coordinates of the target pictures or unrelated. Orthogonal to this manipulation of semantic relatedness, the frequency of the pictures' names was manipulated. The authors observed semantic interference effects in both the immediate and delayed naming conditions but a frequency effect only in the immediate naming condition. These data indicate that semantic interference can be observed when target picture naming latencies do not reflect the bottleneck at the level of lexical selection. In the context of other findings from the picture-word interference paradigm, the authors interpret these data as supporting the view that the semantic interference effect arises at a postlexical level of processing.

The primary predictor of a low replication probability is the reported p-value of <.06, which fails to meet the conventional threshold for statistical significance (p < .05). While the estimated effect size is large, the non-significant p-value indicates that this estimate is highly uncertain and could easily be the result of sampling error. A direct replication of a ""marginally significant"" finding with a modest sample size (N=32) is unlikely to achieve statistical significance.

0.20
The primary reason for the low replication probability is the reported p-value of <.06, which fails to meet the conventional threshold for statistical significance (p < .05) and is a strong predictor of non-replication. While the effect size appears large, this is likely an overestimation due to the small sample size (N=32), a phenomenon known as the ""winner's curse."" The combination of a small sample and a p-value just missing significance suggests the original finding was not robust and is unlikely to be observed again in a new study.
---
0.22
The primary reason for the low predicted replication success is the original study’s reported p-value of <.06, which is not statistically significant at the conventional p<.05 level. Although the reported effect size is medium-to-large, this estimate is unreliable given the small sample size (N=32) and non-significant result, suggesting the finding is likely due to sampling error. A direct replication is therefore highly unlikely to achieve a statistically significant outcome.
---
0.25
The primary reason for the low prediction is that the original finding was not statistically significant by conventional standards (p<.06). A replication is therefore unlikely to achieve a significant result (p<.05), especially given the study's low statistical power from a small sample size (N=32). While the reported effect size is large, it is inconsistent with the provided F-statistic, further undermining confidence in the original result.
---
0.15
The primary reason for the low replication probability is the reported p-value of <.06, which is not statistically significant by conventional standards and is highly characteristic of fragile findings. This borderline result, combined with a small sample size (N=32), suggests the original study was underpowered and the observed effect could easily be due to sampling error. The large reported effect size is likely an overestimation, a common issue in underpowered studies with p-values near the significance threshold."

This prediction is low due to the extremely small sample size (N=8), which provides very little statistical power and produces unstable results that are highly susceptible to sampling error. Furthermore, the reported p-value (p=0.023) is close to the significance threshold of .05, a characteristic associated with lower replication success. Although the study design is a controlled lab experiment, the statistical evidence is simply too weak to expect a successful replication.
---
0.25
The primary reason for the low replication probability is the extremely small sample size (N=8). A p-value of 0.023 from such a small sample provides only weak evidence and is susceptible to high random error. The reported effect size is likely an overestimation, meaning a well-powered replication would probably find a much smaller, non-significant effect.
---
0.25
The prediction is low primarily due to the combination of an extremely small sample size (N=8) and a p-value (p=.023) that is very close to the .05 significance threshold. Such underpowered studies can produce significant results by chance, and these findings are often unstable and difficult to replicate. While the reported analysis is simple, the fragility of the statistical evidence strongly suggests a low probability of replication success.
---
0.25
The prediction is low due to the combination of an extremely small sample size (N=8) and a p‑value (p=0.023) that is just below the conventional significance threshold. Such underpowered studies are more likely to yield false positives or inflated effect size estimates, and findings with p-values close to .05 have historically replicated at lower rates. While the analysis itself is simple, these critical statistical weaknesses strongly suggest a low probability of successful replication.
---
0.25
The primary reasons for this low prediction are the extremely small sample size (N=8) and a p-value (p=0.023) that is only barely significant. Small-N studies are known to be underpowered and can produce inflated effect sizes, making the original finding more likely to be a statistical artifact. Furthermore, the reported effect size (ηp^2 = .09) is mathematically inconsistent with the reported t-statistic, which undermines confidence in the result's accuracy and robustness."

Overshadowing, a tendency for judgments of B to be depressed if A has a higher contingency, is weak or absent when B is better able to account for occurrences than A. Results of several experiments support these and related predictions derived from the accounting for occurrences hypothesis.

The study reports a very low p-value (<.001) and a large effect size, suggesting a robust finding. While the sample size (N=37) is small, this is partially offset by the use of a repeated-measures ANOVA, a powerful within-subjects design that is less sensitive to small samples than between-subjects designs. The combination of a strong signal and an efficient design makes a successful replication likely, though the effect size is probably overestimated.

This study has a very high probability of replication, driven primarily by the extremely large effect size (ηp² = .427) and the correspondingly strong p-value (p<.001). While the sample size of 37 is modest, the powerful within-subjects design (RM ANOVA) is well-suited for detecting such a strong signal. An effect of this magnitude in a core cognitive domain is typically robust and less likely to be a statistical artifact.

0.92
The prediction is high due to the combination of a very small p-value (p<.001) and an extremely large effect size (partial eta-squared = .427), which are strong indicators of a robust finding. Although the sample size is modest, the powerful within-subjects design (RM ANOVA) and the magnitude of the effect suggest it would be readily detected in a replication attempt. The study appears to be a well-controlled cognitive experiment testing specific theoretical predictions, which also tends to increase replicability.

The reported p-value is very low (p<.001) and the effect size is very large (ηp²=.427), which are two of the strongest predictors of replication success. Although the sample size is small, this is partially offset by the use of a powerful within-subjects design (RM ANOVA) in a cognitive psychology paradigm, where effects are often robust. The combination of these factors suggests a strong and reliable finding that is highly likely to replicate.

0.82
The extremely low p-value (p<.001) and very large effect size (ηp² = .427) suggest a robust finding that is highly likely to replicate. While the sample size of 37 is small and poses a risk of effect size inflation, this concern is partly mitigated by the statistical power of the within-subjects (RM ANOVA) design. The sheer magnitude of the reported effect makes it probable that a replication study would also find a statistically significant result."

The reported effect size is extremely large (ηp² = .51) with a very low p-value, suggesting a strong and easily detectable signal. While the sample size of 24 is a major concern that raises the possibility of effect size inflation, this risk is mitigated by the abstract's claim that the finding was demonstrated across five separate experiments. This internal replication within the original paper provides strong evidence for the phenomenon's robustness, making a successful independent replication likely.
---
0.35
The prediction is low despite a strong reported p-value and a very large effect size (ηp² = .51). This is because such a large effect found in a very small sample (N=24) is a classic indicator of effect size inflation, meaning the true effect is likely much smaller. Consequently, a well-powered replication study might fail to detect this more plausible, smaller effect, posing a significant risk to successful replication.
---
0.55
This prediction is uncertain due to conflicting signals. The reported p‑value is low and the effect size (ηp² = .51) is exceptionally large, which would normally suggest high replicability. However, the very small sample size (N=24) makes it highly likely that this effect size is substantially inflated (a “winner’s curse”), and the complex mixed-ANOVA analysis provides flexibility that can lower replicability. While the true effect is likely real, it is probably much smaller, making a replication's success only moderately probable.
---
0.85
Despite a small sample size (N=24), which is a significant risk factor, the reported statistical evidence is exceptionally strong (p < .001, large ηp² = .51), suggesting a potent effect. Critically, the abstract notes the paper contains five experiments, which implies robust internal replication by the authors. This combination of a powerful statistical signal and multiple supporting demonstrations makes a successful replication highly probable.
---
0.65
The study reports a very strong statistical result (p<.01, ηp²=.51), and the conceptual finding is supported by a series of five experiments, which increases confidence in its robustness. However, the very small sample size (N=24) is a significant weakness, as results from small samples are less stable and effect sizes are often inflated. While the strong p-value suggests a real effect is present, its magnitude is likely overestimated, creating a moderate risk that a well-powered replication might yield a smaller, non-significant result."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
Given a changing visual environment, and the limited capacity of visual working memory (VWM), the contents of VWM must be in constant flux. Using a change detection task, the authors show that VWM is subject to obligatory updating in the face of new information. Change detection performance is enhanced when the item that may change is retrospectively cued 1 s after memory encoding and 0.5 s before testing. The retro-cue benefit cannot be explained by memory decay or by a reduction in interference from other items held in VWM. Rather, orienting attention to a single memory item makes VWM more resistant to interference from the test probe. The authors conclude that the content of VWM is volatile unless it receives focused attention, and that the standard change detection task underestimates VWM capacity.

The prediction is low due to the combination of an extremely small sample size (N=12) and a p-value just at the threshold for significance. While the reported effect size is large, such findings from low-powered studies are often inflated and difficult to replicate. Although the retro-cue effect is a plausible phenomenon in cognitive psychology, the statistical evidence from this specific study is very weak.
---
0.35
The primary weaknesses threatening replication are the extremely small sample size (N=12) and a p-value reported at the threshold of significance. This combination results in low statistical power and suggests the very large reported effect size is likely an overestimation. A well-powered, independent replication would probably observe a smaller effect that may not be statistically significant.
---
0.15
This prediction is low due to the extremely small sample size (N=12) and a reported p-value that is critically close to the .05 significance threshold. The F-statistic of 4.8 with (1, 11) degrees of freedom yields a p-value of approximately .051, making the original evidence highly fragile and very unlikely to replicate successfully. While the reported effect size is large, it is almost certainly an overestimation due to the low statistical power of the original study.
---
0.25
The extremely small sample size (N=12) provides low statistical power and leads to unstable estimates. This concern is amplified by the p-value being just at the threshold for significance, suggesting the result is not robust. While the reported effect size is large, such effects are often inflated in underpowered studies and would likely be smaller in a higher-powered replication.
---
0.25
This study's very low sample size (N=12) and marginal p-value are strong predictors of replication failure. The provided test statistic (F(1,11) = 4.8) corresponds to a p-value of approximately .051, which fails to meet the conventional threshold for significance and suggests the original finding may have been a Type I error. While the within-subjects design is a strength, the low statistical power and likely inflated effect size make a successful replication highly improbable."

While the reported test statistic (z=3.10) implies a p‑value much lower than .05 and is a strong positive indicator, this is counteracted by a small sample size (N=68). Such a small sample is a significant concern for a complex analysis comparing four correlated correlations, as correlation estimates are notoriously unstable with few participants. The combination of a small sample and high analytical complexity introduces substantial risk that the finding is not robust, despite the apparently strong statistical evidence.
---
0.65
The strong test statistic (z=3.10, which corresponds to p ≈ .002) is the primary factor suggesting a successful replication, as smaller p-values are strongly correlated with replicability. However, this confidence is tempered by the small sample size (N=68), which can produce unstable and overestimated effects. Furthermore, the complex and uncommon statistical analysis (test of contrast of 4 correlated correlations) could be difficult to reproduce perfectly, introducing another source of uncertainty.
---
0.42
While the test statistic is strong (z=3.10, which corresponds to a p‑value of about .002), several factors reduce confidence in its replicability. The study's sample size is small (N=68), which can lead to inflated and unstable effect estimates. Most importantly, the result relies on a highly complex statistical analysis involving a contrast of correlated correlations derived from a computational model, which creates more flexibility and potential for the finding to be specific to this particular sample.
---
0.38
This study's likelihood of replication is rated as low due to the small sample size (N=68) and the complexity of the analysis. While the test statistic (z=3.10) is strong and implies a low p‑value (p≈.002), such results from small samples can be unstable and overestimate the true effect. The sophisticated and unusual analysis—a test of contrast between four correlated correlations—increases the possibility of analytical errors or hidden flexibility, which can make the specific finding difficult to reproduce.
---
0.65
The prediction is moderately positive primarily due to the strong evidence against the null hypothesis (z=3.10, p≈.002), which is a key predictor of replicability. However, this confidence is substantially lowered by the small sample size (N=68), which risks an inflated original effect size estimate. The complex, non-standard analysis (""test of contrast of 4 correlated correlations"") and the study's placement in social psychology, a subfield with historically lower replication rates, also introduce uncertainty."

This study has a good chance of replicating due to its very large reported effect size (ηp² = 0.241) and the use of a multi-study format, which suggests the phenomenon is robust. However, the small sample size (N=67) is a significant concern, as it suggests the original effect size may be inflated. Therefore, a well-powered replication might find a statistically significant, but smaller, effect.

0.62
The study reports a very large effect size (ηp² = 0.241) and a strong p‑value, which are positive indicators for replication. However, the small sample size (N=67) is a significant concern, as it can lead to inflated effect size estimates and increases the risk of a false positive. The fact that the finding is supported by a series of four studies provides conceptual support, increasing the overall confidence in the phenomenon despite the risk associated with this specific analysis.
---
0.58
The prediction is moderately above chance due to a very low reported p-value (<.01) and a simple ANOVA analysis, both of which are positive indicators for replicability. However, confidence is tempered by the small sample size (N=67), which increases the risk that the extremely large reported effect size (ηp²=0.241) is inflated. Social psychology studies of this nature can also be sensitive to subtle contextual factors, adding uncertainty to a replication attempt.
---
0.82
The prediction is high due to the very strong evidence reported: a large effect size (ηp² = 0.241) and a highly significant p‑value (p < .01) from a straightforward omnibus ANOVA. While the sample size of 67 is modest, the sheer magnitude of the effect suggests it is robust and should be detectable in a replication attempt. The experienced author and the plausible social-cognitive mechanism further bolster confidence in the finding.
---
0.45
The reported p-value is strong (p<.01) and the effect size is very large, which are positive signs for replication. However, the sample size of 67 is quite small, which increases the likelihood that the reported effect size is an overestimation and makes the result less robust. Furthermore, social psychology studies, which often rely on subtle manipulations, have historically shown lower rates of successful replication."

This study has a moderately high chance of replication due to a strong p-value (<.01) and, most importantly, the finding being established across four internal studies, suggesting a robust phenomenon. While the hierarchical regression is a complex analysis, the experienced author and small-to-medium effect size (R^2=.09) are positive indicators. The primary risk factor is the relatively small sample size (N=70), which may have led to an inflated effect size estimate and leaves the study somewhat vulnerable to sampling error in a replication attempt.

0.78
This study has a high likelihood of replication due to the strong statistical evidence (a t‑statistic over 3 yielding a p‑value <.01), which suggests the finding is not a borderline result. Although the sample size of 70 is small for a regression analysis and implies the moderate effect size may be overestimated, this concern is mitigated by the first author's high citation count and the paper's plausible, methods-focused hypothesis. The fact that the finding is based on a series of four studies further increases confidence in its robustness.
---
0.72
This study has a high likelihood of replication, primarily because the reported finding is supported by a programmatic series of four studies, which provides strong internal evidence for the effect's robustness. While the sample size of 70 for any single study is small for a regression analysis—a major risk factor—this is counteracted by a strong p-value (<.01) and a theoretically grounded hypothesis. The overall evidence package suggests the core finding is reliable, even if the effect size from this specific study might be slightly overestimated.
---
0.68
The prediction is based on the strong reported p-value (<.01) and medium effect size (R^2=.09), which are both positive indicators of replicability. However, the relatively small sample size (N=70) for a regression analysis introduces uncertainty and is a notable risk factor, as it can lead to less stable effect size estimates. The experienced author provides some confidence, but the modest sample tempers the overall prediction.

The study reports a strong p-value (<.01) and a medium effect size (R²=.09), which are positive indicators for replication. However, the relatively small sample size (N=70) is a significant concern, as studies with smaller samples can produce inflated and less stable effect estimates. While the social psychology subfield has historically lower replication rates, the finding here is methodological rather than a surprising behavioral effect, which may increase its robustness."

This prediction is very high primarily due to the massive sample size (N > 230,000), which provides immense statistical power and ensures the stability of the results. The extremely large F-statistic and corresponding low p-value indicate a very strong signal in the data, making it highly unlikely to be a chance finding. While the lack of a reported effect size is a limitation, the descriptive nature of the study and the sheer scale of the evidence suggest that these developmental patterns would be robust and observable in a subsequent replication.

This prediction is very high due to the exceptionally large sample size, which provides immense statistical power and ensures the estimates are highly precise and stable. The reported p‑value is extremely low with a very large F‑statistic, making it almost certain that the detected difference in variance is not a result of random chance. While the study is correlational and uses an internet sample, the scale of the data and the straightforward nature of the reported analysis (a test for differences in variance) make the core statistical finding very likely to replicate.

0.96
The study's enormous sample size (N > 230,000) and highly significant test statistic (p < .001) provide extremely high confidence that the reported finding is not a statistical fluke. While the effect size is not reported, the descriptive nature of the research—charting developmental trends in a large, diverse sample—is typically more robust than studies relying on subtle experimental manipulations. A replication with a similarly large sample is therefore very likely to detect the same stable, albeit potentially small, effect."

Note:
Some subfields—such as social or developmental psychology—have historically shown lower replication rates compared to others like clinical or personality psychology, though individual study quality still matters.",0.28,0.35,0.35,0.25,0.32,0.31,"0.28
The prediction is low due to several risk factors. The reported p-value of 0.03 is just below the conventional threshold for significance, indicating a statistically fragile result that has a lower probability of replicating. Furthermore, the original study was underpowered (N=100 for a small effect size), and the subfield of social psychology, particularly terror management theory, has faced challenges in large-scale replication studies.
---
0.35
The prediction is low primarily because the p‑value (0.03) is near the threshold for statistical significance, a factor strongly linked to lower replication rates. The reported effect size (pr^2 = 0.224) is inconsistent with the t‑statistic, which suggests potential reporting errors and an actual effect that is likely small-to-medium. Given the moderate sample size and the study's topic in a subfield with known replication challenges (social priming), the evidence for a robust and replicable effect is weak.
---
0.35
The reported p-value of 0.03 is very close to the conventional 0.05 threshold, indicating a “fragile” result that is less likely to replicate successfully than a result with a much smaller p-value. While the analysis is simple, the effect size (calculated from the t-statistic) is small-to-medium, and studies in this subfield of social psychology can be sensitive to subtle contextual factors. These factors combine to suggest a relatively low probability of replication success.
---
0.25
The reported p-value of 0.03 is just below the conventional threshold for significance, and such ""barely significant"" findings have a lower probability of successful replication. Furthermore, there is a major inconsistency between the reported test statistic (t=-2.22) and the very large effect size (pr^2=0.224), which undermines confidence in the result. The study's subfield (social psychology) and reliance on a subtle manipulation (mortality salience) have also been associated with lower replicability in past large-scale assessments.
---
0.32
The primary concern is the reported p-value of 0.03; being so close to the .05 threshold suggests the finding is statistically weak and has a higher chance of being a false positive. Furthermore, the study is in social psychology and uses a mortality salience prime, a combination that has historically faced replication challenges. While the sample size of 100 is not extremely small, the underlying effect size is likely small, making the result difficult to reproduce without a substantially larger sample."

The predicted probability of replication success is very low due to the combination of a small sample size (N=36) and a p-value (0.02) that is close to the significance threshold. Studies with these characteristics are susceptible to high sampling error and inflated effect size estimates. Furthermore, the topic of broad behavioral priming falls within a subfield of social psychology that has historically demonstrated low replication rates for such effects.
---
0.15
This study has a very high risk of non-replication due to its extremely small sample size (N=36), which makes the finding less credible and the large effect size likely inflated. Furthermore, the p-value is close to the significance threshold, and the study's topic—a broad social priming effect—comes from a subfield that has faced extensive replication failures. These factors combined suggest that the original result may have been a false positive or is, at best, a much smaller effect than reported.

0.15
The prediction is low due to several risk factors: a very small sample size, a p-value just narrowly clearing the significance threshold, and a surprisingly large effect size. Studies in the social priming subfield with these characteristics have a poor track record of replication, as the original findings are often the result of statistical noise or analytical flexibility.
---
0.25
The prediction is low due to a combination of risk factors. The small sample size (N=36) has low statistical power and suggests the large effect size may be inflated, while the p-value (0.02) is fragile and close to the significance threshold. Additionally, studies on broad behavioral priming effects, particularly within social psychology, have historically demonstrated low rates of successful replication.
---
0.18
This study has a low probability of replication due to several high-risk factors. The very small sample size (N=36) provides low statistical power, and the reported p-value of 0.02 is close to the significance threshold, increasing the likelihood of a false positive. Furthermore, the topic of behavioral priming in social psychology has a well-documented history of failed replications, making the extraordinary claim of a large effect from a subtle manipulation less plausible."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
General action and inaction goals can influence the amount of motor or cognitive output irrespective of the type of behavior in question, with the same stimuli producing trivial and important motor and cognitive manifestations normally viewed as parts of different systems. A series of experiments examined the effects of instilling general action and inaction goals using word primes, such as ""action"" and ""rest."" The first 5 experiments showed that the same stimuli influenced motor output, such as doodling on a piece of paper and eating, as well as cognitive output, such as recall and problem solving. The last 2 experiments supported the prediction that these diverse effects can result from the instigation of general action and inaction goals. Specifically, these last 2 studies confirmed that participants were motivated to achieve active or inactive states and that attaining them decreased the effects of the primes on behavior

The prediction is low due to a combination of factors. The reported p-value of 0.02 is close to the conventional significance threshold, a range that has been shown to have lower replication rates. Additionally, the study's use of subtle primes to influence broad, unrelated behaviors is characteristic of social psychology research from an era that has since faced a notable replication crisis.

The study's topic, social priming of general behavior, comes from a subfield that has historically faced significant replication challenges. While the reported effect size is medium, the p-value (0.02) is not highly compelling and is close to the conventional significance threshold, increasing the risk of it being a false positive. The moderate sample size for a between-subjects design also suggests the result may not be robust, especially if the true effect is smaller than what was observed.

0.25
The reported p-value of 0.02 is close to the conventional 0.05 threshold, suggesting the result may not be robust and could be a false positive. The study's focus on broad, abstract social priming is a paradigm known for having low replication rates. While the effect size is medium, findings from studies with modest sample sizes are often inflated, and these primary factors suggest a low probability of successful replication.
---
0.25
The prediction is low primarily because the study investigates broad social priming effects, a subfield with a well-documented history of low replication rates. The reported p-value of 0.02 is close to the conventional significance threshold, which, combined with a modest sample size for a between-subjects design, suggests the result may be fragile or the effect size overestimated. While the first author is highly cited, this is outweighed by the statistical and subfield-specific concerns.
---
0.2
This study's p-value of 0.02 is just below the traditional significance threshold, a characteristic strongly associated with lower replication rates. Furthermore, the study falls within the subfield of social priming, a research area that has historically struggled with replicability, and the reported medium effect size is likely an overestimation given the sample size and marginal p-value. While the analysis is straightforward, the combination of a barely-significant result in a conceptually fraught subfield suggests a low probability of successful replication."

This study's strongest feature is its internal replication, with the effect reportedly found across five studies, which increases confidence. However, the key metrics from the representative experiment are weak: the p-value (p<.02) is close to the significance threshold and the effect size (η²=0.04) is small, both of which are risk factors for replication failure. While the sample size is adequate for a within-subjects design, the small and fragile-looking statistical result tempers the optimism from the series of studies.
---
0.35
This prediction is based on the combination of a p-value that is significant but relatively close to the .05 threshold and a small effect size (partial η² ≈ .04). While the sample size is reasonable for a lab study, small effects are inherently more difficult to replicate and the original finding may be an overestimation due to publication bias. The subfield of social cognition has also historically seen challenges in replicating priming effects, adding to the uncertainty.
---
0.55
While the reported p-value is close to the .05 significance threshold and the effect size is small—both factors that lower replication likelihood—these concerns are substantially offset by the original paper reporting the effect across five separate studies. This successful internal replication is the strongest indicator that the effect, though perhaps small, is likely to be found again in a well-powered, independent attempt. The moderate sample size of the original study provides some stability but also means a replication would need similar or greater numbers to reliably detect the small effect.
---
0.65
The prediction is moderately high because the key finding was reported across five separate studies, suggesting a robust phenomenon. The specific study detailed has an adequate sample size (N=133) and the analysis is straightforward. However, the p-value is not far from the .05 threshold and the effect size is small (η_p² ≈ .04), which means a replication would need to be well-powered to reliably detect the effect.
---
0.35
This prediction is based on the combination of a p-value (<.02) that is close to the traditional significance threshold and a small-to-medium effect size (partial η² ≈ .04 after correcting the likely typo). Such findings are less robust and have a higher chance of being false positives or inflated estimates, making them difficult to replicate. The study's subfield of social psychology also has a historically lower rate of successful replications."

This prediction is relatively low due to the combination of a small sample size and a p‑value that is just below the conventional threshold for significance, two strong predictors of replication failure. Although the reported effect size is large (ηp² = .16), such effects discovered in small samples are often inflated. The use of complex event‑related potential (ERP) methods can also introduce variability that makes direct replication more challenging.
---
0.35
The primary reasons for a low replication estimate are the small sample size (N=33 for the key F-test) and the p-value of .03, which is just below the .05 significance threshold. This combination suggests the study had low statistical power, and the large reported effect size is likely an overestimate that may not be robust. Furthermore, the methodological complexity, combining a behavioral task with event-related potentials (ERPs), introduces many potential points of failure in a replication attempt.
---
0.25
The predicted probability is low primarily due to the very small sample size for the key analysis (N≈33, inferred from df), which provides low statistical power and increases the chance of error. This concern is amplified by a p-value of .03, which is only narrowly significant and more likely to be a false positive than a much smaller p-value. The complex mixed ANOVA and large but potentially inflated effect size further suggest the original finding may not be robust.
---
0.35
The prediction is low primarily due to the small sample size (N=33 for the key F‑test) combined with a p‑value (0.03) that is just below the threshold for significance. While the reported effect size is large, estimates from underpowered studies are often inflated, and findings from such analyses are less likely to replicate successfully. The complexity of a mixed ANOVA with neurophysiological data (ERPs) can also introduce analytical flexibility that may contribute to fragile results.
---
0.35
This study has a high risk of non-replication due to its small sample size (N=33 for the key F‑test) and a p‑value (p=0.03) that is just below the significance threshold. These factors suggest the study was underpowered, and the large reported effect size is likely inflated. The social psychology subfield has also historically demonstrated lower average replication rates, which adds to the concern."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
The action-based model of dissonance predicts that following decisional commitment, approach-oriented motivational processes occur to assist in translating the decision into effective and unconflicted behavior. Therefore, the modulation of these approach-oriented processes should affect the degree to which individuals change their attitudes to be more consistent with the decisional commitment (spreading of alternatives). Experiment 1 demonstrated that a neurofeedback-induced decrease in relative left frontal cortical activation, which has been implicated in approach motivational processes, caused a reduction in spreading of alternatives. Experiment 2 manipulated an action-oriented mindset following a decision and demonstrated that the action-oriented mindset caused increased activation in the left frontal cortical region as well as increased spreading of alternatives. Discussion focuses on how this integration of neuroscience and dissonance theory benefits both parent literatures.

The primary concern is the statistically marginal result; the reported F‑statistic yields a p-value just under the .05 threshold, which is a strong predictor of replication failure. While the sample size is moderate for a lab study and the reported effect size is large, this combination with a borderline p-value suggests the true effect may be smaller and the original finding unstable. The technical complexity of the neurofeedback paradigm further introduces potential challenges for a direct replication.
---
0.35
The primary reason for this low prediction is the reported p-value being just under the .05 threshold, which indicates weak evidence that may not hold up in a replication attempt. Although the sample size is moderate, this combination suggests the reported medium-to-large effect size is likely an overestimation of the true effect. The complexity of the neurofeedback manipulation and cognitive neuroscience paradigm could also pose challenges for a direct replication.
---
0.25
The reported p-value of <.05, derived from an F-statistic of 3.19, is just barely significant (p≈.048), which is a strong negative predictor for replicability. This marginal result, combined with a modest sample size, suggests that the study had low statistical power and the reported medium-to-large effect size is likely an overestimation. The use of a complex neurofeedback paradigm in one experiment could also pose challenges for a direct replication.
---
0.25
The primary concern is the reported p-value of <.05, which corresponds to an F-statistic that is barely statistically significant (p≈.0485), a strong negative predictor of replication success. While the sample size is moderate and the reported effect size is medium-to-large, such borderline findings are often difficult to reproduce, especially when they involve complex neuroscientific manipulations like neurofeedback.
---
0.35
The primary negative indicator is the p-value, which at F(2, 54) = 3.19 is approximately .049, placing it just under the conventional significance threshold and decreasing the likelihood of a successful replication. Although the reported effect size (ηp²=0.11) is medium-to-large, the moderate sample size suggests this estimate may be inflated due to the ""winner's curse."" The study's complex design, integrating a neurofeedback manipulation within a social psychology paradigm, also introduces multiple potential points of failure for a direct replication."

The prediction is high due to the combination of a very small p‑value (p<.0001) and a large effect size (ηp² = 0.143), which are strong indicators of replicability. Although the sample size is modest and the finding is an interaction, the statistical evidence is exceptionally compelling.

The reported evidence is strong, characterized by a very small p‑value and a large effect size, which suggests the finding is not a statistical artifact. While the sample size is moderate, it is more than sufficient to detect an effect of this magnitude, and the straightforward ANOVA analysis reduces concerns about analytical flexibility. The high citation count of the author and the study's focus on nuanced boundary conditions, rather than an overly broad claim, further increase confidence in its robustness.

This study has a high probability of replication due to its very low p-value (p < .0001) and large effect size (ηp² = 0.14). These strong statistical indicators, combined with a standard ANOVA and a respectable sample size for detecting a large effect, suggest a robust finding. While the abstract's focus on ""boundary conditions"" could imply a context-sensitive effect, the reported statistics for this core result are compelling.

0.85
This prediction is high due to the very strong statistical evidence for the reported finding. A p‑value of <.0001 and a large effect size (ηp² = 0.14) in a sample of over 100 participants indicate a robust, non-borderline result that is likely to be detected again in a replication. Although the study's overall theory is complex, this specific effect is statistically compelling, and the first author's high citation count is also a positive indicator.

0.88
This study has a high probability of successful replication due to its very strong statistical evidence, including a p-value well below .001 and a large effect size (ηp² = 0.1433). While the sample size is moderate, it was sufficient to detect an effect of this magnitude with very high power, suggesting the finding is not a statistical fluke. Although the subfield of social psychology and the study of interaction effects can sometimes show lower replicability, the compelling statistical metrics for this specific finding make it very likely to be robust."

The authors present a model positing that when people are insecure about a relationship partner's acceptance, they often express emotional vulnerabilities to the partner, which causes them to believe the partner views them as highly vulnerable and insecure. In turn, this belief causes them to doubt the authenticity of the partner's expressions of positive regard, which may perpetuate the experience and expression of insecurity that initiated the process. Prototypes of interactions with interpersonally vulnerable individuals included partners' inauthentic expressions of regard (Study 1). Suggesting that these prototypes are applied to personal relationships when vulnerabilities are expressed, those who claimed to have expressed vulnerabilities doubted the partner's authenticity because they believed that they were viewed as vulnerable (Studies 2A, 2B, and 4). Authenticity doubts in turn predicted perceptions of rejection (Studies 3 and 4), which in turn predicted partner derogation and subsequent expressions of vulnerability (Study 4). An experimental manipulation of reflected appraisals of vulnerability increased doubts about the authenticity of a new acquaintance's expressions of emotion (Study 5). Relational insecurity may be perpetuated via the intrapersonal cognitive consequences of expressing it.

This prediction is driven primarily by the combination of a small effect size (partial η² = 0.028) and a p-value that is close to the conventional significance threshold of .05. Such small effects are often overestimated in original studies and require larger samples to be detected reliably, making them statistically fragile. While the sample size of 186 is moderate and the experimental design (RM ANOVA) is a strength, these factors may not be enough to overcome the weak signal suggested by the key metrics.
---
0.35
The prediction is low primarily because the reported p-value is just below the .05 significance threshold, a factor strongly associated with replication failure. This concern is amplified by the small effect size (ηp² = 0.028), which indicates the effect may not be robust and would require a larger sample than the one used for reliable detection. The complex, multi-step nature of the theoretical model also introduces more potential points of failure for a successful replication.
---
0.35
The replication probability is low primarily because the reported p-value is just below the conventional .05 threshold and the corresponding effect size is small (ηp² = 0.028). This combination suggests the original study was underpowered, making the finding less robust and highly sensitive to sampling error. A direct replication would require a substantially larger sample to reliably detect such a small effect.
---
0.35
This prediction is low primarily due to weak statistical evidence; the reported p-value is close to the .05 threshold and the effect size (ηp² = 0.028) is small. This combination suggests the original study may have been underpowered and the result is not robust, making it vulnerable to failing a replication attempt. While the sample size is not trivial and the experimental design is a strength, these factors are unlikely to overcome the high probability of a false positive or inflated effect indicated by the other metrics.
---
0.24
This prediction is low due to multiple indicators of statistical fragility. A p-value just under the .05 threshold combined with a small effect size (ηp² = 0.028) suggests the finding is not robust, a common profile for studies that fail to replicate. The moderate sample size was likely underpowered to reliably detect such a small effect, and the subfield of social psychology has historically seen lower replication rates for complex phenomena."

The prediction is very high due to multiple converging factors that suggest a robust finding. The reported p-value is very low (<.001) and the effect size is exceptionally large (R2=.68), making it highly likely that a replication would detect the effect. Most importantly, the abstract describes a series of five studies using different methodologies (experimental, longitudinal) that all support the central hypothesis, serving as a strong internal replication that increases confidence against this being a chance finding.
---
0.88
This study has a high probability of replication due to the combination of a very small p‑value (<.001) and an exceptionally large effect size (R² = .68), which together signal a strong and highly detectable effect. The use of a multi-study design provides further confidence by demonstrating the finding across different contexts and operationalizations. The sample size of 153 is more than sufficient to power the detection of an effect of this magnitude, even with a complex multilevel model.
---
0.88
This study has several indicators of high replicability, including a very low p-value (<.001) and a very large reported effect size (R² = .68), which suggest a robust finding. Confidence is further bolstered because the effect was demonstrated across a series of five studies using different methodologies, reducing the chance that the result is an artifact of a single design. While the complex statistical model (multilevel model) and the unusually large effect size introduce some uncertainty due to analytical flexibility and potential overestimation, the strength and consistency of the evidence make a successful replication highly probable.
---
0.92
This study is highly likely to replicate successfully due to its very strong statistical evidence, including a p-value well below the standard threshold (<.001) and an extremely large reported effect size (R² = .68). While the effect size is unusually large for the field, it, along with the adequate sample size and the fact that the finding is part of a converging series of five studies, strongly suggests a robust and easily detectable effect. The author's established research record further bolsters this confidence.
---
0.85
The prediction is high due to very strong statistical evidence, including a low p‑value (<.001) and an extremely large effect size (R2 = .68) in a decent sample. While the social psychology subfield has shown lower replication rates and such a large effect could suggest measurement overlap, the reported statistical certainty is a powerful positive signal. Moreover, the use of a five‑study package with converging experimental and longitudinal evidence significantly increases confidence that an independent replication would succeed."

Furthermore, the moderate sample size provides relatively low statistical power to reliably detect the observed small-to-medium effect size (d = .45), making a successful replication uncertain. While the straightforward experimental design and analysis are positive factors, the statistical weaknesses are considerable.
---
0.62
This prediction is moderately positive due to the respectable sample size (N=110) and the use of a simple, standard t-test, which reduces analytical complexity. However, the reported p-value (<.05) is significant but not highly compelling, and the small-to-medium effect size (d=.45) suggests the phenomenon may be subtle. The study's straightforward experimental design and grounding in established theory slightly increase confidence in a successful replication.
---
0.65
This prediction is based on a mix of positive and cautionary factors. The study’s use of a simple t-test and a moderate effect size (d=.45) are favorable for replication, as they reduce ambiguity in the analysis. However, the sample size is not large and the p-value, while significant, is not extremely low (calculated as p≈.02), which tempers the expectation of success.
---
0.67
This study has a moderate-to-good chance of replication. The effect is plausible and grounded in an established theory, and the simple t‑test analysis reduces the risk of complex errors or p‑hacking. However, the reported p‑value is not overwhelmingly strong, and the sample size is only moderate, meaning the original study was not highly powered to detect an effect smaller than the observed d = .45, introducing some risk of a non-significant finding in a replication.
---
0.62
This prediction balances favorable and unfavorable factors. The simple t-test analysis and plausible medium effect size (d = .45) are positive signs for replication. However, the sample size provides only moderate statistical power, and the p-value, while significant, is not overwhelmingly low, which, combined with the social psychology subfield, suggests a reasonable but not certain chance of success."

This prediction is based on the p-value (<.02), which is significant but not highly convincing, and the modest sample size (N=71) for a between-subjects design, which may lead to an overestimated effect size. While the reported medium effect (d=.56) is promising, the analytical complexity of measuring 1/f noise introduces a potential point of failure for a direct replication. These statistical and methodological concerns temper the confidence suggested by the established author and the two-study design.
---
0.42
The reported p-value is close to the .05 threshold and the sample size of 71 provides only modest statistical power for a between-subjects design, increasing the risk that the original finding was a false positive. The primary concern is the complexity and novelty of the dependent measure (""1/f noise"" derived from Fourier analysis), as subtle differences in the analysis pipeline could easily lead a replication to fail. Although the reported medium effect size is a positive sign, the combination of marginal statistical evidence and high analytical complexity suggests a below-average likelihood of replication success.
---
0.45
The reported p-value is less than .02, which is statistically significant but close enough to the .05 threshold to warrant caution, as such findings often have lower replication rates. While the medium effect size (d=.56) and straightforward ANOVA are positive indicators, the moderate sample size (N=71) means the effect estimate is not highly precise. The novelty of applying 1/f noise analysis to social psychology may also introduce unknown methodological sensitivities that could affect replicability.
---
0.35
The reported p-value of <.02 is only narrowly significant and is associated with lower replication rates. More critically, the dependent variable (1/f noise) is derived from a complex Fourier analysis, a non-standard procedure in this subfield that introduces many potential hidden moderators or points of methodological divergence for a replicating lab. While the effect size is medium, the modest sample size provides limited statistical power, increasing the risk that the original result is fragile.
---
0.45
The reported p-value (<.02) is significant but not highly compelling, and studies with p-values near the .05 threshold have shown lower replication rates. While the medium effect size is promising, the sample size is modest for a between-subjects design, which can result in less stable estimates. The primary concern is the complexity and novelty of the key dependent variable (1/f noise), as its calculation via Fourier analysis may be sensitive to minor procedural or analytical variations that are difficult to reproduce exactly."

This study reports a very strong signal, with an extremely large effect size (ηp² = .362) and a correspondingly low p-value (<.0001). Such a large effect should be readily detectable and replicable, even with a moderate sample size. The only minor reservation is that effects based on priming cognitive states can sometimes be sensitive to subtle procedural details not fully captured in the methods.

The prediction is very high due to the exceptionally large reported effect size (ηp² = .362) and the correspondingly small p-value (<.0001), which suggest a very strong and easily detectable phenomenon. While the sample size is modest, the effect is so large that it should be readily found again, a conclusion supported by the fact that the original paper demonstrated the finding across a series of five experiments. The straightforward ANOVA analysis and the high citation count of the first author further increase confidence in the robustness of the result.

This study has a very high probability of replication primarily due to the extremely large reported effect size (ηp² = .362) and the highly significant p-value (p < .0001). While the sample size of 82 is moderate, it is more than adequate to detect an effect of this magnitude. The finding's robustness is further supported by its demonstration across five separate experiments and the use of a standard ANOVA, which limits analytical flexibility.

0.92
This prediction is high due to the exceptionally strong statistical evidence for the reported finding. The p‑value is very small (<.0001) and the effect size (ηp² = .362) is massive, both of which are powerful predictors of replication success. While the social-cognitive manipulation could be subtle, the effect is so large that it should be easily detected in a well-powered replication, and the experienced author and report of five successful internal experiments further increase confidence.

0.88
This study has a very high probability of replication due to its extremely strong statistical evidence; the reported p-value is tiny (<.0001) and the effect size is very large (ηp² = .362), making the finding robust and easily detectable. While social psychology studies can have lower replication rates and the sample is not large, the immense strength of this specific result, demonstrated across five separate experiments, strongly suggests it is a reliable phenomenon. The experienced author and straightforward ANOVA analysis further increase confidence in the finding."

This study's very small sample size (N=45) is a major concern, as it can lead to inflated and unstable effect size estimates. However, this risk is substantially mitigated by the strong reported signal (p < .01, ηp² = .186) and the fact that the paper presents a series of seven studies demonstrating the same core finding. While the effect size in a replication may be smaller, the programmatic nature of the research suggests the underlying effect is robust and likely to replicate successfully.
---
0.45
The primary concern for replication is the very small sample size (N=45), which can produce statistically significant but unreliable results with inflated effect sizes. While the reported p‑value is strong (p<.01) and the effect size is very large (ηp² = .186), these metrics are less trustworthy when derived from a low-powered study. The high risk of the original finding being a substantial overestimation makes a successful replication only moderately likely.
---
0.40
The primary concern for replication is the small sample size (N=45), which makes the study's estimates less stable and increases the chance that the very large reported effect size (ηp² = .186) is inflated. While the p-value is strong and the underlying theory is plausible, a direct replication with a new sample would likely find a smaller, more realistic effect. This smaller true effect may not be large enough to produce a statistically significant result in a similar-sized replication attempt.
---
0.40
This prediction is driven primarily by the very small sample size (N=45), which suggests the study was underpowered and that the reported large effect size (partial η² = .186) may be an overestimation due to sampling error. While the p-value is strong (p < .01), confidence in this result is substantially weakened by the small sample, a primary risk factor for replication failure. The author’s experience is a positive sign, but it does not outweigh the fundamental statistical weakness.
---
0.65
Although the small sample size (N=45) is a major concern and suggests the large reported effect size may be inflated, the finding is supported by a program of 7 studies using diverse methods. This pattern of internal replication across multiple contexts provides strong evidence that the effect is not a statistical artifact. A well-powered independent replication is therefore likely to find a significant result, even if the true effect is smaller than what was reported in this specific study."

The primary drivers for this low estimate are the p-value being just under the .05 significance threshold and the small reported effect size (ηp² = 0.035). This combination suggests the finding may be a statistical artifact or an overestimation of the true effect, making it difficult to reproduce. Although the sample size (N=122) is moderate, it is likely underpowered for reliably detecting such a small effect, which further reduces confidence in the stability of the finding.

0.35
The prediction is low due to a convergence of risk factors. The reported p‑value is just under the .05 significance threshold (an F‑value of 4.15 with these degrees of freedom corresponds to p≈.044), which is strongly associated with lower replication rates. This is coupled with a small effect size (ηp² = 0.035), suggesting that the original study may have been underpowered and the result could be a statistical artifact or an overestimation.
---
0.35
The primary reason for the low replication estimate is the reported p‑value being just under the .05 threshold (the F‑statistic corresponds to p≈.044), which is a strong indicator of a fragile result. This weak evidence, combined with a small-to-medium effect size (ηp² = 0.035) and a modest sample size, suggests the original study was underpowered, increasing the likelihood that the finding was a false positive or an overestimated effect. While the simple ANOVA is a positive factor, it does not overcome the concerns raised by the other key metrics.
---
0.35
This prediction is low primarily due to the combination of a small effect size (ηp² = 0.035) and a p‑value that is just below the .05 significance threshold. Studies with p‑values this close to the cutoff have a lower replication rate, and the small effect indicates the original study was underpowered, meaning a replication of a similar size would have a low probability of detecting the effect. The author's experience and straightforward analysis are positive but are outweighed by these key statistical weaknesses.
---
0.35
The predicted probability is low primarily because the reported p-value is just below the .05 threshold, a factor strongly associated with lower replication rates. This concern is amplified by the small effect size (ηp² = 0.035), suggesting the finding may not be robust. The study's subfield of social psychology has also historically shown lower replication success, particularly for subtle belief-based phenomena."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
The present research tests whether recognition for the nonverbal expression of pride generalizes across cultures. Study 1 provided the first evidence for cross-cultural recognition of pride, demonstrating that the expression generalizes across Italy and the United States. Study 2 found that the pride expression generalizes beyond Western cultures; individuals from a preliterate, highly isolated tribe in Burkina Faso, West Africa, reliably recognized pride, regardless of whether it was displayed by African or American targets. These Burkinabe participants were unlikely to have learned the pride expression through cross-cultural transmission, so their recognition suggests that pride may be a human universal. Studies 3 and 4 used drawn figures to systematically manipulate the ethnicity and gender of targets showing the expression, and demonstrated that pride recognition generalizes across male and female targets of African, Asian, and Caucasian descent. Discussion focuses on the implications of the findings for the universality of the pride expression.

The prediction is high due to the very large reported effect size (average proportion of 0.78), which is the strongest predictor of replicability. The study's use of a simple binomial test and a strong design testing an isolated preliterate tribe also bolsters confidence in the core finding. Although the sample size is moderate and the p-value is imprecisely reported, the magnitude of the effect suggests the phenomenon is robust and likely to be replicated successfully.

0.92
This study has a very high probability of replication, primarily driven by its large effect size (average proportion of 0.78 is very high for a recognition task). The analysis is a simple binomial test, reducing the likelihood of complex errors or p-hacking. Although the p-value is not reported precisely, a large effect with a moderate sample size (N=211) provides strong evidence that the finding is robust and not a statistical artifact.
---
0.88
This study has a very high probability of successful replication due to a combination of a very large effect size (an average correct identification proportion of 0.78 is substantial) and a simple, constrained statistical analysis (binomial test), which minimizes analytical flexibility. The use of multiple studies, including one with a preliterate and isolated cultural group, provides strong, converging evidence for a robust phenomenon. While the p-value is imprecisely reported, the sheer magnitude of the effect suggests the finding is not a statistical artifact.
---
0.82
This prediction is high due to the very large effect size (average 78% recognition), which suggests a robust phenomenon that is easy to detect. The study's design is also strong, testing for universality with a simple analysis (binomial test) across multiple cultures, including an isolated one. While the reported p-value is borderline, the strength of the effect and the conceptual soundness of the research in a foundational area of psychology make successful replication very likely.
---
0.88
This study has a high probability of replication due to its very large effect size (an average proportion of 0.78 is far from chance) and straightforward analysis (binomial test), which is less prone to error. The strong study design, which includes a preliterate, isolated tribe to test universality, provides compelling evidence that is difficult to attribute to confounding factors. While the imprecise p-value reporting (`p < .05`) and social psychology subfield are potential risk factors, the sheer size of the effect and the robust methodology make a successful replication very likely."

This prediction is based on a strong p-value (.002) and a respectable sample size (N=261), both of which are positive indicators for replicability.

The reported p-value is quite low (p = .002) and the sample size (N = 261) is substantial, providing a solid statistical foundation for the finding. While the small-to-medium effect size (ηp² = .042) is not enormous, the original study was well-powered to detect it. Although persuasion effects in social psychology can be sensitive to context, the strong primary evidence suggests a good likelihood of replication.

While the effect size (ηp²=.042) is small-to-moderate, it was detected with a robust F-statistic, suggesting it is not a statistical artifact. The primary risk is its subfield, social psychology, where subtle experimental manipulations can sometimes prove difficult to reproduce perfectly across different contexts."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
People's opinions can deviate from that of the average group member in two ways. Descriptive deviants diverge from the average group attitude in a direction consistent with the desirable group attitude; prescriptive deviants diverge from the average group attitude in a direction inconsistent with the desirable group attitude. Three studies tested the hypothesis that descriptive deviants are more willing to express their opinions than either nondeviants or prescriptive deviants. Study 1 found that college students reported more comfort in expressing descriptive deviant opinions because descriptive deviance induced feelings of superior conformity (i.e., being ""different but good""). Study 2 found that descriptive deviants reported more pride after expressing their opinions, were rated as more proud by an observer, and were more willing to publicize their opinions. Study 3 showed that political bumper stickers with descriptive deviant messages were displayed disproportionately more frequently than were those with prescriptive deviant messages.

The reported p-value is just under the .05 threshold, which, combined with the very small sample size (N=37), makes this specific finding statistically fragile and highly susceptible to sampling error. While the reported effect size is medium, estimates from small-N, marginally significant studies are often inflated. These factors suggest a low probability of a successful direct replication, even though the analysis is simple and the paper presents other conceptually similar findings.

0.35
The reported p-value is just below the conventional .05 threshold of significance, as the chi-squared value of 3.85 is only slightly greater than the critical value of 3.84. Such ""just-significant"" p-values are less likely to replicate successfully. This concern is amplified by the very small sample size (N=37), which yields low statistical power and a wide confidence interval around the medium effect size, suggesting the result is unstable.
---
0.3
The prediction is low due to the combination of a very small sample size (N=37) and a p-value just under the .05 threshold, as the test statistic is barely significant. Such underpowered findings are often fragile and may represent a Type I error or a substantially inflated effect size. While the reported effect is medium, this estimate is likely unreliable and may not be robust enough to replicate successfully.
---
0.25
The prediction is low due to the combination of a very small sample size (N=37) and a p-value that just crosses the threshold for significance (p < .05 from χ²=3.85). These factors suggest the original study was underpowered, meaning the reported medium effect size is likely inflated and the result has a high chance of being a false positive. While the concept is supported by multiple studies in the paper, the statistical evidence for this specific finding is fragile.

0.31
This finding has a low probability of replication due to its very small sample size and a p-value that is just barely below the .05 significance threshold. This combination suggests the result is statistically fragile and may be a false positive, a concern amplified by the historically lower replication rates in social psychology. While the effect size is medium, estimates from underpowered, just-significant studies are often inflated."

The study has a respectable sample size and a p-value well below the .05 threshold, which are positive signs for replicability. However, the reported effect size (ηp² = 0.041) is in the small-to-medium range, and complex interaction effects are often more fragile and harder to replicate than simple main effects. While the presence of four supporting studies in the original paper suggests some robustness, the small effect size introduces a notable risk that a replication attempt could fail to detect it.

The study has a decent sample size and a p-value well below the standard .05 threshold, which are positive indicators for replication. However, the reported effect size (ηp² = 0.041) is small-to-medium, and such effects can be difficult to detect reliably. The complexity of the proposed interaction effect, a common feature in social psychology, also introduces uncertainty as these findings can be sensitive to minor contextual changes.

The reported p-value is strong (p<.01) and was obtained from a reasonably large sample for this type of research, suggesting a reliable signal. While the effect size is small-to-medium (ηp²=0.041), the most compelling factor is the reporting of four separate studies demonstrating the same interaction, which suggests the finding is robust across different contexts. The use of a standard ANOVA also reduces concerns about analytical flexibility that can lower replicability.

The reported p-value is strong (p<.01) and the sample size (N=246) provided high statistical power for the observed small-to-medium effect size (ηp²=0.041), which are positive indicators. However, the finding is a nuanced interaction effect within social psychology, a type of result that can be sensitive to subtle contextual factors and is often more difficult to replicate than a simple main effect. Therefore, the overall probability of success is good, but not certain.

The reported p-value is strong (p<.01) for the adequate sample size, and the abstract's description of four separate studies demonstrating the same interaction suggests the effect is robust. While the effect size is relatively small (__p^2 = 0.041) and social psychology findings can be difficult to replicate, the internal replication series strongly increases confidence in the finding."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
The authors investigated whether an implemental mind-set fosters stronger attitudes. Participants who made a decision about how to act (vs. those who held off) expressed a more extreme attitude toward an issue unrelated to the decision (Experiment 1). Participants who planned the implementation of a decision (vs. deliberated vs. control) exhibited less ambivalent (Experiment 2) and more accessible (Experiment 3) attitudes toward various objects unrelated to the decision. Moreover, an attitude reported by planning participants better predicted self-reported behavior 1 week later (Experiment 4). Finally, results suggest that the effect of an implemental mind-set on attitude strength toward unrelated objects is driven by a focus on information that supports an already-made decision (Experiment 5). Implications for attitudes, goals, and mind-sets are discussed.

This prediction is low due to the combination of a very small sample size (N=46) and a p-value (<.05) that is close to the significance threshold. While the reported effect size (ηp² = 0.135) is large, findings from underpowered studies are often inflated and less likely to replicate with the same magnitude. The social-cognitive nature of the ""mind-set"" manipulation may also be sensitive to subtle variations, further challenging direct replication.
---
0.28
This prediction is low due to several risk factors for replication failure. The sample size (N=46) is very small for a three-group design, which reduces statistical power and can lead to inflated effect size estimates. Furthermore, the reported p-value is just under the .05 significance threshold, and such marginal results are often less likely to replicate successfully. While the paper includes five experiments, the weak evidence in this specific instance suggests the underlying effect may not be robust.

0.25
The primary reasons for this low prediction are the very small sample size (N=46) and the p-value being just below the .05 threshold. While the reported effect size is large, such findings in underpowered studies are often inflated and less likely to replicate successfully. The abstract social-cognitive nature of the ""implemental mind-set"" manipulation may also be sensitive to subtle variations in experimental procedure, further lowering replicability.
---
0.25
The prediction is low due to the very small sample size and a p-value just under the .05 threshold, which suggests the finding may be fragile. This combination also implies the reported large effect size is likely inflated and would be substantially smaller in a higher-powered replication. Furthermore, novel findings from subtle ""mind-set"" manipulations in social psychology have historically had lower replication rates.
---
0.20
The probability of replication is low primarily due to the very small sample size (N=46) and a p-value just under the .05 threshold, indicating a statistically fragile result. This combination also suggests the large reported effect size (ηp² = 0.135) is likely an overestimation. Additionally, subtle mindset effects from the subfield of social psychology have historically proven difficult to replicate."

The prediction is moderately high due to the medium effect size (ηp² = .07) and a p-value that is stronger than the reported “<.05” might imply (the F-statistic corresponds to p ≈ .01). The study’s use of a standard between-subjects ANOVA is also a positive sign, as simpler analyses are often more replicable. The primary weakness is the moderate sample size (N=94), which provides only adequate statistical power and slightly increases the risk of a failed replication due to sampling error.

This prediction is based on strong statistical evidence from the original study, including a medium effect size (ηp² = .07) and a p‑value (calculated as p≈.01 from the F‑statistic) that is well below the typical significance threshold. While the sample size is only moderate and social psychology findings can be context‑sensitive, the strength of the original statistics and the straightforward ANOVA design suggest a robust effect that is likely to replicate.

While the reported effect size (ηp² = .07) is medium and the calculated p-value (p ≈ .01) is fairly strong, these positive signs are tempered by other factors. The sample size of 94 is only moderately powered for a between-subjects design, increasing the risk of an overestimated effect. Furthermore, the study is in social psychology, a subfield where complex, context-dependent effects have historically shown lower rates of successful replication."

The reported p-value is extremely close to the .05 threshold given the small sample size (N=50) and effect size (r=.30), suggesting the finding is fragile and may not be robust. Such ""just-significant"" results have a low probability of replicating, as minor sampling variation in a new study could easily yield a non-significant outcome. The use of a partial correlation with many implied covariates (df=41 for N=50) also adds complexity, which can reduce replicability.

0.25
This study has a low probability of replication due to several statistical weaknesses. The sample size of 50 is small for a correlational design, providing low power and yielding a very wide confidence interval around the reported effect size. Most importantly, the reported p-value of <.05 is highly fragile, as the exact p-value for r(41) = .30 is p≈.052 (two-tailed), meaning the result is not statistically significant by conventional standards and may be the product of questionable research practices.
---
0.25
The probability of successful replication is low. The primary concerns are the small sample size (N=50) and the ""just-significant"" p-value, which together suggest the study was underpowered and the reported effect size (r=.30) is likely an overestimation. Furthermore, the use of a partial correlation with many covariates for such a small sample increases the risk of a spurious finding due to high analytical flexibility.

0.25
This study has a low probability of replication due to its small sample size (N=50) and a p-value that is just below the conventional threshold for significance. Such marginal results are often susceptible to sampling error, and the reported medium effect size (r=.30) is likely an overestimation due to the ""winner's curse."" A well-powered replication study would probably observe a much smaller, non-significant effect.
---
0.25
This study has a low probability of replication success due to several statistical weaknesses. The sample size (N=50) is small for a correlational design, resulting in low statistical power and a higher chance that the finding is a false positive. The reported p-value of <.05, paired with a small effect size (r=.30), is likely very close to the significance threshold, making the result fragile and susceptible to effect size inflation (the “winner’s curse”)."

While the reported p-value is low (0.001) and the effect size is very large, the small sample size (N=52) is a significant concern for replicability. Such a small sample yields less stable estimates and increases the likelihood that the strong result is a product of sampling error or an overestimated effect. The complexity of the proposed mechanism, a ""shifting salient selection criterion,"" may also be difficult to reliably reproduce in a new sample.

0.45
The study reports a very strong signal (p=0.001, d=1.16), which normally suggests high replicability. However, the sample size (N=52) is very small, which substantially increases the risk of a false positive and can lead to inflated effect size estimates. Given that the study investigates a complex interaction in social psychology, a subfield with known replication challenges, the low statistical power of the original study warrants skepticism.

0.68
The reported p-value is very low (p = .001) and the effect size is very large (d ≈ 1.17), both of which are strong positive predictors of replication success. However, the small sample size (N=52) is a significant concern, as it can lead to unstable and inflated effect size estimates, reducing confidence in the finding's robustness. While the simple chi-squared analysis is a plus, the study's social psychology context and small sample temper the optimism from the strong headline statistics.
---
0.68
This prediction balances the study's strong statistical evidence against its primary methodological weakness. The very low p‑value (p = .001) and large effect size (d ≈ 1.17) are strong positive indicators for replication, but the small sample size (N=52) suggests the reported effect may be substantially overestimated and thus less robust. While the analysis is simple and the author is established, the surprising nature of the finding (a complete preference reversal) warrants some caution.

This prediction balances the study's strong statistical evidence against its methodological weaknesses. The very low p-value (p=0.001) and large reported effect size are powerful positive indicators for replication success. However, the small sample size (N=52) is a significant concern, as it can produce unstable results and inflated effect sizes, a risk compounded by the study’s subfield of social psychology which has historically shown lower replication rates."

This prediction is low primarily because the study investigates ego depletion, a research area notorious for poor replicability within social psychology. Additionally, the p-value of 0.02 is only marginally significant, and when found with a modest sample size (N=85), it suggests the medium-to-large effect size may be an overestimation that would not hold up in a direct replication attempt. The claim of ruling out multiple alternatives and establishing mediation adds theoretical complexity, which is often harder to replicate than a simple main effect.

0.15
The likelihood of successful replication is low due to multiple risk factors. The study investigates ego depletion, a controversial topic in social psychology with a history of failed replications. Additionally, the reported p-value of 0.02 is only marginally significant, and the relatively small sample size for a between-subjects design raises the possibility that the observed medium-to-large effect size is an overestimation.
---
0.18
The primary reason for this low prediction is the study's topic of ego depletion, a research area in social psychology with a well-documented history of replication failures. This concern is amplified by the combination of a small sample size (N=85) and a p-value (0.02) that is close to the significance threshold of 0.05. While the reported effect size is medium, such findings from low-powered studies are often inflated and less likely to replicate successfully.

0.25
The prediction is low primarily because the study is based on the concept of “ego depletion,” a theory that has performed very poorly in large-scale, pre-registered replication attempts. This foundational weakness is compounded by a relatively small sample size (N=85 for a between-subjects design) and a p-value (p=.02) that is close to the conventional significance threshold. These factors suggest a high risk of being a false positive or having an inflated effect size, outweighing the author’s experience and the reported medium effect size.
---
0.15
This prediction is low due to several high-risk factors for non-replication. The study investigates ego depletion, a controversial topic in social psychology with a history of failed replications, and reports a p-value (0.02) that is just below the significance threshold. Furthermore, the relatively small sample size (N=85) for a between-subjects design suggests the study was underpowered, which can lead to inflated effect size estimates and an increased likelihood of a false positive."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
Four studies investigate the role that stereotype threat plays in producing racial distancing behavior in an anticipated conversation paradigm. It was hypothesized that the threat of appearing racist may have the ironic effect of causing Whites to distance themselves from Black conversation partners. In Study 1, participants distanced themselves more from Black partners under conditions of threat, and this distance correlated with the activation of a ""White racist"" stereotype. In Study 2, it was demonstrated that Whites' interracial distancing behavior was not predicted by explicit or implicit prejudice. Study 3 provides evidence that conceiving of interracial interactions as opportunities to learn may attenuate the negative consequences of threat for Whites. Study 4 found that Whites have conscious access to their experience of stereotype threat and that this awareness may mediate the relationship between threat and distance. These results are discussed within a broader discourse of racial distancing and the possibility that certain identity threats may be as important as prejudice in determining the outcomes of interracial interactions.

Some subfields—such as social or developmental psychology—have historically shown lower replication rates compared to others like clinical or personality psychology, though individual study quality still matters.",0.42,0.62,0.65,0.45,0.35,0.498,"0.42
While the reported p-value is low (<.01) and the effect size is large, the small sample size of 55 participants is a significant concern for a between-subjects experimental design. Small samples often yield unstable results and inflated effect size estimates, increasing the risk that a replication attempt with a larger, more appropriate sample would find a weaker and potentially non-significant effect. Furthermore, findings in social psychology that rely on subtle manipulations can be highly context-dependent, adding to the replication challenge.
---
0.62
This prediction is moderately positive due to the strong p-value (p < .01) and large reported effect size (ηp² = .16), which are favorable indicators of replication. However, the small sample size of 55 for a between-subjects design introduces significant uncertainty and raises the possibility that the effect size is overestimated. While the multi-study format of the paper is a strength, the social psychology subfield and the complexity of measuring behavioral responses to stereotype threat temper the overall confidence in a successful replication.
---
0.65
The reported p-value is substantially below the .05 threshold (p<.01) and the effect size is large, both of which are positive indicators for replication. However, the small sample size (N=55) suggests the effect size estimate may be inflated, which poses a significant risk to a replication attempt. The study's social psychology context, focusing on a potentially sensitive manipulation (stereotype threat), also adds a degree of uncertainty as such effects can be highly sensitive to procedural variations.

0.45
While the reported p-value is strong (<.01) and the effect size is large (ηp² = .16), the small sample size of 55 participants in a between-subjects design is a significant concern. Such small samples can produce unstable and inflated effect size estimates, and the study's topic of stereotype threat involves a social manipulation that can be highly sensitive to context. These factors combined suggest a successful replication is plausible but moderately uncertain.
---
0.35
This prediction is low primarily due to the very small sample size (N=55), which makes the findings less stable and increases the chance that the large reported effect size is an overestimation. Furthermore, studies in social psychology, particularly those involving subtle experimental manipulations like stereotype threat, have historically demonstrated lower replication rates. While the p-value is strong, these other methodological and field-specific factors suggest a high risk of replication failure."

The probability of replication success is high because the study's primary claim is a null finding, supported by a high p-value (0.48) and a very small effect size (r = .04). Replicating a null effect is often more likely than replicating a borderline-significant one, as the original data strongly suggest the absence of an effect. Although the multilevel analysis is complex, the finding is so far from statistical significance that a replication is very likely to yield a similar non-significant result.
---
0.88
This study reports a null finding with very strong supporting evidence, including a high p-value (.48) and a negligible effect size (r = .04). A successful replication would also find a null effect, which is highly probable given the original data showed a relationship so close to zero. While the analytical approach is quite complex, the effect is so small that a replication using a similar sample size and a reasonable alternative analysis is also very likely to yield a non-significant result.
---
0.85
The prediction is high because the original study reports a clear null finding (p = .48) with a trivial effect size (r = .04), making it probable that a replication would also find a non‑significant result. This would constitute a successful replication of a null effect. Although the highly complex statistical analysis is a negative factor for replicability, the reported statistical evidence points so strongly toward a null finding that it is likely to be robust.
---
0.88
The study’s central claim is a null finding, supported by a very high p-value (0.48) and a trivial effect size (r = .04). A successful replication would therefore also be expected to find a non-significant result. Given the extremely small effect found in the original study, it is highly probable that a well-powered replication would confirm the absence of a meaningful effect.
---
0.65
The study's key claim is a null effect (p = .48, r = .04), which is often more likely to replicate than a borderline-significant result, as the observed effect is already near zero. However, the high complexity of the analysis (""meta-analytic summary of... 14 multilevel models"") and the suspiciously low degrees of freedom (26) for the sample size (163) suggest the result might be an artifact of a specific, non-robust analytical pipeline. While the finding is theoretically plausible, the methodological concerns and the study's placement in social psychology—a subfield with historically lower replication rates—temper the prediction."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
A model of risk regulation is proposed to explain how low and high self-esteem people balance the tension between self-protection and connectedness goals in romantic relationships. This model assumes that interpersonal risk automatically activates connectedness and self-protection goals. The activation of these competing goals then triggers an executive control system that resolves this goal conflict. One correlational study and 8 experiments manipulating risk, goal strength, and executive strength and then measuring implicit and explicit goal activation and execution strongly supported the model. For people high in self-esteem, risk triggers a control system that directs them toward the situations of dependence within their relationship that can fulfill connectedness goals. For people low in self-esteem, however, the activation of connectedness goals triggers a control system that prioritizes self-protection goals and directs them away from situations where they need to trust or depend on their partner.

The probability is estimated as moderately high due to the strong statistical evidence, including a p‑value well below .05 (p<.01) and a medium-to-large effect size (sr^2 = .07). The programmatic nature of the research, which includes nine total studies, suggests a robust phenomenon, and the first author is well-established. However, the sample size is only moderate for detecting a complex interaction in a regression analysis, which tempers the prediction slightly.
---
0.42
Although the reported p-value (<.01) and medium effect size (sr^2 = .07) are promising, the study's moderate sample size (N=91) is a significant concern. This sample provides relatively low statistical power to reliably detect the reported effect, suggesting the original result may be an overestimate and thus more difficult to replicate. Furthermore, complex interaction effects in social psychology often show lower replication rates than simpler main effects.
---
0.65
The reported p-value is strong (p<.01) and the effect size is moderate (sr^2=.07), which are the most important factors favoring successful replication. However, the sample size of 91 is somewhat small for a hierarchical regression analysis, which can lead to an inflated effect size estimate and lower statistical power in a replication attempt. The complexity of the social-cognitive model and analysis also introduces some uncertainty, as intricate interactions can be more difficult to reproduce than simple main effects.
---
0.68
This prediction is based on the strong statistical evidence, including a p-value well below .05 (t=3.05) and a medium effect size (sr^2 = .07). However, the sample size of 91 is only moderate for a hierarchical regression analysis, which slightly tempers confidence in the stability of the finding. Additionally, the complexity of the social-cognitive theory and the use of interaction effects can sometimes make precise replication more challenging.
---
0.62
The prediction is moderately optimistic due to the strong p-value (<.01) and medium effect size (sr^2 = .07), which suggest the finding is not a statistical fluke. However, this optimism is tempered by the moderate sample size for a complex regression analysis and the study’s origin in social psychology, a subfield with a history of mixed replication outcomes. Overall, the statistical evidence is promising, but the study characteristics introduce some uncertainty."

This prediction is low due to several critical weaknesses in the original study. The sample size (N=28) is extremely small, which provides low statistical power and leads to an unstable and likely inflated effect size estimate. Most importantly, the reported test statistic (t=1.87) corresponds to a p-value of approximately .07, which contradicts the claim that p<.05 and suggests the original finding was not statistically significant by conventional standards. These statistical issues severely undermine confidence that the result is robust and would replicate.
---
0.25
The study’s very small sample size (N=28) and a p-value that is barely significant (and potentially misreported, as t(26)=1.87 yields p=.072 for a two-tailed test) are strong indicators of low replicability. Such conditions often lead to inflated effect size estimates and a high risk of a false positive result. The finding's basis in social psychology, a subfield where subtle effects on motivation and self-esteem have historically been difficult to replicate, adds to this concern.
---
0.18
The predicted probability of replication is very low due to a combination of severe statistical weaknesses. The sample size (N=28) is extremely small, which provides very low statistical power and leads to highly unstable and likely inflated effect size estimates. Moreover, the reported p-value is suspiciously close to the .05 threshold, as the t-statistic of 1.87 is only significant if a one-tailed test was performed, a classic indicator of a fragile finding that is unlikely to replicate.
---
0.15
The reported p-value (<.05) is inconsistent with the reported test statistic (t(26) = 1.87), which yields an actual p-value of approximately .073; this statistical discrepancy is a major red flag. Furthermore, the very small sample size (N=28) means the study had low statistical power, making the original result less reliable and the large effect size estimate likely inflated. These factors combined suggest a low probability of successful replication.
---
0.22
The very small sample size (N=28) provides low statistical power, which makes the finding susceptible to being a false positive. The test statistic is very close to the conventional p<.05 significance threshold, indicating the evidence is weak and not robust. Small-sample studies with p-values this close to the cutoff, particularly in social psychology, have a low probability of successful replication and the reported large effect size is likely inflated."

A high probability is predicted based on very strong statistical evidence; the study reports a highly significant p‑value (0.001) and a large effect size (ηp² = .14). While the sample size is moderate and social psychology findings can be context-sensitive, the strength of the original evidence suggests the effect is robust and should replicate. The straightforward ANOVA analysis also increases confidence in this finding.
---
0.88
This prediction is high due to the very low p-value (p = .001) and the large reported effect size (partial η² = .14), which together signal a strong and readily detectable phenomenon. While the sample size is moderate, it was clearly sufficient to produce a robust statistical result. The use of three experiments in the original paper, including mediational tests, also suggests a conceptually sound and internally replicated finding, increasing the likelihood of a successful independent replication.
---
0.68
The prediction is based on strong reported statistical evidence; the p-value is very low (0.001) and the effect size is large (__p^2 = .143), which are both strong positive indicators for replicability. However, the sample size of 90 is relatively small for this type of design, which could lead to an overestimation of the true effect size and introduces some uncertainty. The standard ANOVA analysis is a positive sign, but the strong signal from the key metrics ultimately suggests a successful replication is more likely than not.
---
0.85
The probability of successful replication is high, primarily driven by the very strong statistical evidence: a highly significant p-value (0.001) and a large effect size (__p^2 = .14). These metrics suggest the finding is not a statistical artifact. While the sample size (N=90) is moderate, it was clearly sufficient for detecting this robust effect, and the use of a standard ANOVA adds to the study's straightforwardness and likely replicability.
---
0.80
The reported p-value is very low (p=.001) and the effect size is large (__p^2 = .14), both of which are strong predictors of a successful replication. The sample size of 90 provides excellent statistical power for an effect of this magnitude. While the subfield of social psychology can have lower replication rates due to sensitivity to context, the powerful statistical evidence from a standard analysis suggests this finding is likely robust."

The probability of replication is low primarily because the reported p-value of 0.05 corresponds to a test statistic that is just at the threshold of statistical significance, suggesting the result is fragile. Furthermore, the effect size is small (phi = .13), which means the original study was underpowered to detect it reliably, and an exact replication would have a low chance of success even if the effect is real. The study's focus on subtle fluency manipulations, a topic in social cognition with a mixed replication history, also contributes to the low prediction.
---
0.15
The reported p-value of 0.05 is at the bare threshold for significance and corresponds to a test statistic that is technically non-significant (p≈0.0503), which is a strong predictor of replication failure. This borderline result, combined with a small effect size (phi = .13) and a sample size (N=236) that provides low statistical power for this effect, suggests the original finding is not robust. Furthermore, surprising effects in social cognition involving subtle manipulations have historically shown low replication rates.
---
0.35
This study's reported p-value of exactly .05 is a strong negative predictor of replicability, as results just meeting the significance threshold often fail to replicate. The small effect size (phi = .13) further suggests the finding may not be robust or could be an overestimation of the true effect. While the sample size is adequate and the analysis is simple, these positive factors are outweighed by the marginal statistical significance of the original result.
---
0.35
The prediction is low primarily due to the combination of a small effect size (phi = .13) and a p‑value at the threshold of significance (p = .05). These figures suggest the original study had low statistical power, meaning even a perfect replication would have a low chance of finding a significant effect. While the sample size is moderate and the author is established, these factors do not overcome the high risk associated with a ""just-significant"" finding for a subtle effect in social cognition.
---
0.25
This prediction is low due to a convergence of major risk factors. The reported p-value of exactly 0.05, combined with a small effect size (phi = .13), suggests the result is fragile and may have been obtained through questionable research practices or is simply a Type I error from an underpowered study. Additionally, the topic falls within social cognition, a subfield notorious for replication failures involving subtle experimental manipulations influencing complex thought."

This prediction is driven by the combination of a small sample size (N=36) and a p-value that is close to the .05 threshold, which are strong predictors of replication failure. Although the reported effect size is large (d=0.82), findings from low-powered studies often have inflated effect size estimates. The use of young children as participants can also introduce procedural sensitivity, making the effect more difficult to reproduce precisely.
---
0.35
The prediction is low primarily due to the combination of a small sample size and a p-value reported just under the conventional significance threshold of .05. This pattern often indicates that the large reported effect size is likely inflated and that the result may not be robust. Additionally, specific interaction effects, such as the one described, can be more difficult to reliably replicate than simple main effects.
---
0.35
The study's small sample size (N=36) and a p-value just below the .05 threshold are strong negative predictors of replicability. While the reported effect size is large (d=0.82), such estimates are often inflated in small samples and are likely to regress to the mean in a replication attempt. The original evidence is therefore statistically weak, making a successful replication with a new sample less likely.
---
0.35
The primary predictors of low replicability here are the small sample size (N=36) and a p-value that is statistically significant but close to the .05 threshold. This combination suggests that the large reported effect size may be inflated due to sampling error. While the experimental design is straightforward, such statistically weak evidence from a small group of young children is often difficult to reproduce successfully in a new, independent sample.
---
0.38
The study's low sample size (N=36) and a p-value that is significant but not highly so (p<.05, from F(1,34)=5.8) raise concerns about statistical power and the stability of the result. While the reported effect size is large, such effects are often inflated in small samples and may not be reproducible. The specific nature of the finding—an interaction effect in young children—can also be delicate and difficult to replicate perfectly."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
Is nonconscious goal pursuit useful in novel environments? The prevalent view of automaticity and control implies that an unconscious mode of goal pursuit can only reproduce formerly learned actions, and therefore that its usefulness in novel environments is very limited. Our results demonstrate that this conclusion is not always warranted, as nonconscious goal pursuit facilitated participants' learning of the structure of completely novel environments. Specifically, two experiments, using markedly different implicit-learning paradigms, demonstrated facilitation of implicit learning when the goal of achievement was primed. We propose that nonconscious goal pursuit can facilitate not only reproductive operations, but also productive ones, and that implicit learning is sensitive to the organism's nonconscious goals.

The low replication probability is predicted due to multiple factors common in findings that fail to replicate. The study’s topic, nonconscious priming, is in a subfield with a known replication crisis. The reported test statistic yields a p-value just under the .05 significance threshold, a range highly susceptible to publication bias and p‑hacking. This, combined with a modest sample size and a non-standard reported p‑value (`prep`), makes the original result likely to be statistically fragile.
---
0.25
The reported p-value is approximately .04 (inferred from the t-statistic), which is just below the significance threshold and represents relatively weak evidence. This, combined with a modest sample size of 86 for a between-subjects design, results in low statistical power to reliably detect the small-to-moderate effect. Furthermore, the topic of nonconscious priming has a well-documented history of replication failures, making a successful replication of this finding unlikely.
---
0.18
This prediction is low due to a convergence of risk factors common in studies that fail to replicate. The research area, nonconscious priming, has a poor replication record, and the reported test statistic corresponds to a p-value (p≈.04) that is just barely significant, suggesting a high chance of being a false positive. While the analysis is simple, the modest sample size provides low statistical power for the reported effect size, making it likely that the original finding was due to chance or that the effect is substantially smaller than reported.
---
0.32
The reported p-value is very close to the .05 significance threshold (a t-statistic of 2.09 with 84 df corresponds to p=.04), which is a strong negative predictor of replication success. Furthermore, the study's topic of nonconscious priming falls into a subfield with a well-documented history of replication failures. The modest sample size and small-to-medium effect size further suggest the original finding may be fragile and susceptible to publication bias.
---
0.25
The study has a high risk of replication failure. The p-value, calculated from the reported t-statistic, is approximately .039, a value just below the conventional significance threshold that is often difficult to replicate. This borderline result, combined with a relatively small sample size for a between-subjects design and a topic in social priming—a subfield with a history of low replicability—suggests the original finding may be a false positive or have a substantially overestimated effect size."

This study demonstrates multiple signs of high replicability, most notably an extremely large effect size (ηp² = .326) and a correspondingly low p-value (p < .001). The finding is supported by a large sample size (N=280), which increases the stability and precision of the estimate. While the topic is in social psychology, a field with mixed replication history, the use of a computational modeling approach suggests a controlled, lab-based design which tends to be more robust.

This study has a very high probability of replication due to its exceptionally large effect size (ηp² = .326) and the correspondingly strong statistical evidence (p < .001, F = 123.38). The large sample size (N=280) further increases confidence in the stability of this finding. While the computational modeling approach might introduce some complexity, the sheer magnitude of the effect suggests it is robust and should be easily detected in a new sample.
---
0.92
The prediction is high due to the exceptionally large reported effect size (ηp² = .326) and the highly significant p-value (p < .001), which suggest a very robust finding. The adequate sample size (N=280) provides sufficient power to detect such an effect, and the use of a standard general linear model for analysis reduces concerns about analytical flexibility. These factors combined point to a high likelihood of successful replication.
---
0.92
This prediction is high due to the exceptionally strong statistical evidence. The very low p-value (<.001), large effect size (ηp² = .326), and substantial sample size (N=280) are all powerful indicators of a robust and replicable finding. Additionally, the use of a standard general linear model and a likely well-controlled experimental paradigm common in cognitive and social psychology increases confidence in the result.
---
0.92
The prediction is high due to overwhelmingly strong statistical evidence, including a large sample size (N=280), a very small p-value (p<.001), and a very large effect size (ηp² = .326). Such a robust reported effect is highly likely to be detected again in a direct replication. While social psychology studies can have lower replication rates, the strong quantitative signals in this paper suggest a high probability of success."

This study has a high probability of replication due to several positive signals, including a series of five internal replications and a highly cited first author, suggesting robust findings. Although the sample size is modest, the reported F‑statistic is strong (implying p≈.01 and a medium effect size) and the underlying phenomenon (anchoring) is well-established in cognitive psychology. The primary negative signal is the small reported effect size, which is inconsistent with the test statistic and likely an error.
---
0.40
While the study investigates a plausible extension of a classic cognitive bias using a standard analysis, the modest sample size and p-value (p ≈ .011, calculated from the F-statistic) offer only moderate evidence. More importantly, there is a major inconsistency between the reported F-statistic (which implies a medium-to-large effect, ηp² ≈ .11) and the reported small effect size (η² = .02). Such statistical reporting errors are a significant red flag that correlate with lower replication rates and reduce confidence in the finding’s robustness.
---
0.72
This prediction is based on the study's solid theoretical foundation, which builds on the robust anchoring effect, and its straightforward experimental design. The reported F‑statistic is reasonably strong (implying p≈.01 and a medium effect size), but the relatively small sample size and a major inconsistency between the test statistic and the reported effect size (η²=.02) introduce significant uncertainty. Assuming the F‑value is the correct metric, the study is likely to replicate, but the risk of an overestimated effect tempers this prediction.

The study investigates a modification of the anchoring effect, a robust finding in cognitive psychology, and was conducted by a highly-cited author, both factors favoring replicability. However, the sample size is small, and there is a major inconsistency between the significant F-statistic (F=6.88, p≈.01) and the reported negligible effect size (η²=.02), indicating reporting error. Assuming the F-value is correct and the effect size is a typo, the finding is likely real and replicable due to its strong theoretical and empirical background, though the original effect size may be inflated.
---
0.40
This prediction is primarily driven by the combination of a small sample size (N=59) and a very small reported effect size (η² = .02). This pairing results in low statistical power, meaning the original significant result may have been a chance finding or an overestimation of the true effect. While the reported test statistic is significant (p ≈ .011), it is not overwhelmingly so, and studies with small effects and modest p-values are often less likely to replicate successfully."

The data for this study come from 141 college-age participants (97 females, 44 males) who responded to 11 yes/no questions presented in random order over headphones. The questions were derived from propositions in the Internet-based Mindpixel project and had varying truth values (defined as the proportion of participants who responded that they were true). These results show that both the spatial extent and the temporal dynamics of motor movements can provide insight into high-level cognition.

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
Here, we document, for the first time, the pull toward contrasting responses during evaluative thinking, reporting the results of a study examining the trajectory of participants' reaching movements toward different response options. The data for this study come from 141 college-age participants (97 females, 44 males) who responded to 11 yes/no questions presented in random order over headphones. The questions were derived from propositions in the Internet-based Mindpixel project and had varying truth values (defined as the proportion of participants who responded that they were true). These results show that both the spatial extent and the temporal dynamics of motor movements can provide insight into high-level cognition. Our results are consistent with previous claims regarding proposition verification. Specifically, we found that evaluating a proposition as false exhibits more difficulty compared with evaluating a proposition as true. Not only were ""NO"" responses slower than ""YES"" responses, but the ""YES"" alternative conspicuously competed with the ""NO"" alternative.

Some subfields—such as social or developmental psychology—have historically shown lower replication rates compared to others like clinical or personality psychology, though individual study quality still matters.",0.25,0.45,0.42,0.25,0.85,0.444,"0.25
The reported F-statistic has extremely low degrees of freedom (df = 1, 9), which suggests that despite the sizable participant pool, the analysis was based on a very small number of items (~10), giving it low statistical power. This low power, combined with a p-value near the significance threshold and a very large reported effect size (r = -0.7), is a classic sign of an inflated effect estimate. A replication attempt is therefore likely to find a much smaller and potentially non-significant effect.
---
0.45
The study reports a large sample size and a very strong effect size (r = -0.7), which are positive indicators for replication. However, the reported test statistic, F(1, 9) = 8.7, has critically low degrees of freedom, suggesting the analysis had very low statistical power (perhaps relying on a small number of items rather than participants). Such low-powered tests can produce inflated effect sizes and findings that are less likely to replicate, leading to a modest prediction of success.
---
0.42
The primary concern is the low statistical power of the key test, as indicated by the F(1, 9) statistic, which suggests the analysis was based on a very small number of items (N≈11) rather than the 141 participants. While the reported effect size is large (r = -0.7), such effects are often overestimated in low-powered studies, and the p-value is not overwhelmingly strong. The finding's consistency with established cognitive theory (""truth bias"") is a positive factor, but the statistical evidence presented is weak and may not be readily reproduced.
---
0.25
The reported F-statistic has extremely low denominator degrees of freedom (df=9), which is inconsistent with the large participant sample size and suggests a very low-powered statistical test (e.g., an analysis by items). While the reported effect size is large, significant results from low-powered studies are often inflated and have a lower probability of direct replication. Therefore, the statistical evidence is much weaker than it first appears.
---
0.85
The prediction is high due to the exceptionally large reported effect size (r = -0.7) and a solid sample size for a lab-based cognitive study. A strong, statistically significant finding with objective measures like motor trajectories is generally robust and less susceptible to extraneous factors. While the ANOVA's degrees of freedom (df = 9) seem low relative to the participant count, suggesting an item-level analysis, the strength of the reported effect strongly suggests the finding would replicate."

A successful replication is highly likely due to the convergence of several strong indicators: a very large reported effect size (d = .93), an extremely low p‑value (implied by t=10.36), and a decent sample size. The use of a simple single-sample t‑test further increases confidence, as it minimizes the potential for the result to be an artifact of analytical complexity or hidden researcher degrees of freedom.

0.94
The prediction for successful replication is very high due to the convergence of several strong factors. The reported effect size is very large (d = .93), which is corroborated by an extremely high t‑statistic, suggesting the finding is not a statistical artifact. This conclusion is further supported by the simple analysis (a single sample t‑test) and a sufficient sample size, which all point to a robust and easily detectable effect.
---
0.93
This study has a very high probability of successful replication due to multiple strong factors. The reported effect size is large (d = 0.93), the statistical evidence is overwhelming (t(124) = 10.36, indicating a very low p-value), and the sample size is adequate for detecting such an effect. Most importantly, the use of a simple single-sample t-test offers very little analytical flexibility, meaning the result is less likely to be an artifact of complex or questionable data-analysis choices.
---
0.92
The probability of replication is very high due to the extremely large effect size (d = .93) and a correspondingly low p-value, as indicated by the massive t‑statistic. The analysis is a simple single-sample t-test, which is transparent and easy to reproduce correctly, and the sample size is sufficient to reliably detect such a strong effect. These factors combined suggest a robust finding that should replicate successfully.
---
0.92
The prediction is high due to the combination of a very large effect size (d = .93) and an extremely significant p‑value, as inferred from the large t‑statistic. The study also benefits from a straightforward statistical analysis (single-sample t‑test) and an adequate sample size, which increases confidence in the stability of the finding. While the social psychology subfield has shown lower replication rates historically, the strength of the statistical evidence in this specific case suggests a high likelihood of successful replication."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
Episodic memory enables individuals to recollect past events as well as imagine possible future scenarios. Although the episodic specificity of past events declines as people grow older, it is unknown whether the same is true for future events. In an adapted version of the Autobiographical Interview, young and older participants generated past and future events. Transcriptions were segmented into distinct details that were classified as either internal (episodic) or external.

This study has a high probability of replication due to its very large effect size (ηp² = .326) and highly significant p-value, which suggest a strong signal. The main weakness is the small sample size (N=32), which can lead to inflated effect size estimates and lower stability. However, the finding is theoretically grounded and extends a previously replicated result, which increases confidence that the reported effect is not a statistical artifact.

This study has a high likelihood of replication due to its very strong statistical evidence, including a very large effect size (ηp² = .326) and a highly significant p-value (p < .001, calculated from the F-statistic). The primary weakness is the small sample size (N=32), which can lead to inflated effect estimates and lower statistical power. However, the reported effect is so large that it is likely to be detected again, even if its true magnitude is smaller.

0.75
The prediction is moderately high due to the very strong statistical evidence, including a large F‑statistic which corresponds to a very low p‑value (p < .001) and a large effect size. However, this confidence is tempered by the very small sample size (N=32), which is a major weakness as it can lead to unstable and inflated effect size estimates. While the reported effect is likely an overestimate, its sheer magnitude suggests a true underlying effect is present and would likely be detected in a replication.

0.75
The prediction is moderately high due to a very strong reported effect. The extremely low p‑value (p < .001, inferred from the F‑statistic) and very large effect size (ηp² = 0.326) suggest a robust finding that is likely to replicate, even if the effect shrinks. However, this confidence is tempered by the very small sample size (N=32), which increases the risk that the original result was an overestimate due to sampling error.
---
0.68
The study reports a very large effect size (ηp²= 0.326) and a highly significant p-value, which are strong positive indicators for replication. However, this is significantly counterbalanced by the very small sample size (N=32), which carries a high risk that the reported effect is an overestimation due to the “winner’s curse.” While the finding is theory-driven and extends a known effect, this low statistical power is the primary threat to a successful replication."

This study has a moderately high chance of replication due to its strong statistical evidence (t(31)=3.23 implies p < .01) and a respectable medium effect size (d=.571). While the small sample size of 32 is a significant risk factor for stability, this is partly offset by the use of a powerful within-subjects design (dependent t-test). The straightforward analysis and the study's grounding in a core, well-understood area of developmental psychology also increase confidence in the finding.
---
0.75
This prediction balances the study's primary strength—strong statistical evidence including a medium effect size and a low p-value (p ≈ .002)—against its main weakness of a small sample size (N=32). While a small sample increases uncertainty and the risk of an inflated effect estimate, the straightforward t-test analysis and the study's basis in a well-established area of developmental psychology boost confidence in its replicability.
---
0.68
This study has a strong p-value (the reported `t(31)=3.23` corresponds to p≈.003) and uses a simple t-test, which limits analytical flexibility and potential for p-hacking. However, the small sample size (N=32) is a major concern, as such studies are prone to inflated effect sizes and are less likely to replicate than those with larger samples. The medium effect size is plausible, but confidence is tempered by the small N.
---
0.72
The reported p‑value is very low (p≈.002, calculated from the t‑statistic), which is a strong predictor of replication success, as is the simple and powerful dependent t‑test design. However, the primary risk factor is the small sample size of 32, which can produce unstable results and inflated effect size estimates. Overall, the strength of the statistical evidence for this theoretically plausible finding outweighs the risk from the small sample, suggesting a good chance of replication success.
---
0.65
The study reports a strong p-value (inferred from prep≈.97 to be p<.01) and a medium effect size (d=.571), which are positive indicators for replication. However, the very small sample size (N=32) makes the effect size estimate less stable and prone to inflation. While the finding is theoretically plausible in developmental psychology, this subfield has historically faced replication challenges, resulting in a moderate probability of success."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
A crowd often possesses better information than do the individuals it comprises. For example, if people are asked to guess the weight of a prize-winning ox, the error of the average response is substantially smaller than the average error of individual estimates. This fact, which Galton interpreted as support for democratic governance, is responsible for the success of polling the audience in the television program ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire"" and for the superiority of combined over individual financial forecasts. Researchers agree that this wisdom-of-crowds effect depends on a statistical fact: The crowd's average will be more accurate as long as some of the error of one individual is statistically independent of the error of other individuals--as seems almost guaranteed to be the case. We recruited 428 participants from an Internet-based subject pool and asked them eight questions probing their real-world knowledge. Although people assume that their first guess about a matter of fact exhausts the best information available to them, a forced second guess contributes additional information, such that the average of two guesses is better than either guess alone. This observed benefit of averaging multiple responses from the same person suggests that responses made by a subject are sampled from an internal probability distribution, rather than deterministically selected on the basis of all the knowledge a subject has.

The prediction is high due to the strong statistical evidence, including a low p‑value (<.01) and a substantial sample size (N=173) for a within‑subjects design. Furthermore, the study employs a simple dependent t‑test and a straightforward online procedure, making it easy to replicate accurately. The small‑to‑medium effect size (d=0.47) was detected with high power and is likely to be found again in a subsequent study.
---
0.92
The study has a high likelihood of replication due to strong statistical evidence, including a very low p-value (p ≈ .0001 calculated from the t-statistic) and an adequate sample size for the observed medium effect size (d = 0.47). The use of a powerful within-subjects design and a simple, standard analysis (dependent t-test) further increases confidence in the finding's robustness. The phenomenon itself, a core cognitive process, is less susceptible to the contextual moderators that can affect replication in other subfields.
---
0.88
This study has a high probability of replication due to its strong statistical evidence and methodological simplicity. The reported p-value is low (<.01) for a decent sample size (N=173), and the dependent t-test is a straightforward analysis with little room for questionable research practices. While the effect size is moderate (d=0.47), the simple, plausible cognitive mechanism being tested suggests the finding is likely to be robust.
---
0.88
The probability of successful replication is high due to the strong p-value (<.01) obtained from a well-powered sample (N=173) for a within-subjects design. The analysis (a dependent t-test) is simple and standard, which reduces analytical flexibility, and the finding is a plausible extension of a known cognitive phenomenon. While the effect size is moderate (d=0.47), a direct replication with a similar sample size would be very likely to detect it.
---
0.88
The study has a high probability of replication due to strong statistical evidence, including a p-value well below .01 from a reasonably large sample, which suggests the finding is not a borderline case. The analysis is a simple dependent t-test, and the effect itself is a plausible cognitive phenomenon based on a core statistical principle, making it less likely to be an artifact of a complex design or analysis. The experienced author and cognitive subfield further increase confidence in the result's robustness."

The prediction is high due to exceptionally strong statistical evidence, including a very small p-value (<.00001) and a large effect size (__p^2 = .308). Although the sample size is very small (N=12), the powerful within‑subjects design and sheer magnitude of the F‑statistic suggest the finding is robust and not a statistical fluke. Furthermore, the study builds on a classic, well‑established phenomenon in cognitive psychology (the attentional blink), a subfield with a generally higher rate of successful replication.

0.92
The reported p-value is extremely small (<.00001) and the effect size is very large (ηp² = .308), indicating a strong signal. While the sample size is small (N=12), the study uses a within‑subjects ANOVA on a robust cognitive phenomenon (the attentional blink), and the large error degrees of freedom suggest many trials per participant, which increases statistical power. These factors combined suggest a high likelihood of successful replication.
---
0.82
This study reports an extremely strong signal, with a very low p-value (<.00001) and a large effect size (partial ηp2 = .308), making replication likely. While the sample size is very small (N=12), the use of a within-subjects design to investigate a robust phenomenon like the attentional blink makes a large effect plausible. The primary risk is that the effect size is overestimated, but the signal is so strong it would likely remain significant in a replication attempt, even if diminished.
---
0.85
The extremely low p-value (<.00001) and very large effect size (partial η² = .308) provide strong evidence for a robust effect. While the sample size is very small (N=12), this is somewhat mitigated by the study’s within-subjects design investigating a classic, high-signal cognitive phenomenon (the attentional blink). The strong statistical signal and highly controlled paradigm make a successful replication highly probable, even if the original effect size is inflated.
---
0.88
This prediction is high due to the extremely small p‑value and very large effect size, which suggest a robust finding despite the small sample size. The study uses a within-subjects design common in cognitive psychology, which is statistically powerful and in a subfield with a better-than-average replication record. While the small sample of 12 is a notable weakness that may lead to an overestimated effect size, the overwhelming statistical evidence makes it highly probable that a replication would find a significant effect in the same direction."

This study's key finding relies on the glucose model of ego depletion, a hypothesis that has performed very poorly in large-scale, pre-registered replication attempts. While the sample size is moderate, the p-value (p ≈ .023, calculated from the F-statistic) is close to the .05 threshold and the effect size is small, both of which are associated with lower replication rates. The combination of a fragile statistical result with a highly contested and likely spurious underlying theory makes a successful replication very unlikely.

The prediction for a low replication probability is primarily driven by the study's topic and its statistical evidence. The hypothesis, based on the glucose model of self-control (ego depletion), comes from a subfield that has faced significant, well-documented replication failures. Furthermore, the reported statistics (an F-value corresponding to a p-value just under .05 and a small effect size) suggest the original evidence was not very strong, which in an underpowered study increases the likelihood of a false positive or an inflated effect.

The study's topic, the glucose model of ego depletion, has performed very poorly in large-scale replication projects, making its core theoretical basis highly suspect. Furthermore, the reported p-value (p≈.023, inferred from the F-statistic) is close to the significance threshold, and the sample size is underpowered to reliably detect the observed small-to-medium effect size (ηp² = .045). These factors combined suggest a very low probability of a successful independent replication.
---
0.15
This study's low predicted replication success is primarily due to its subject matter, as the glucose model of ego depletion is a subfield that has performed very poorly in subsequent replication attempts. This conceptual problem is compounded by the marginal statistical evidence; the reported F-statistic yields a p-value of p≈.023, which is close to the significance threshold, and a small effect size (ηp² = .045). These factors suggest the finding is not robust and is at high risk of being a false positive.

The prediction is low because the study tests the glucose model of ego depletion, a hypothesis from social psychology that has performed very poorly in large, pre-registered replication attempts. Furthermore, the original result is only marginally significant (the reported statistics correspond to p ≈ .023) with a modest effect size (ηp² = .045). These factors combined suggest the original finding is unlikely to be robust and replicable."

This study has a low probability of replication due to the combination of a very small sample size (N=31) and a p‑value reported as just under the significance threshold (p<.05). This pattern suggests the finding is statistically fragile and may be the result of sampling error, with the reported medium effect size (r=-.38) likely being an overestimation. While the analysis is simple, the noisy nature of psychophysiological data (ERN, startle) further compounds the difficulty of obtaining a robust and replicable effect without a much larger sample.

The prediction is low due to the combination of a small sample size (N=31) and a p-value just below the .05 significance threshold. This pairing suggests the result is statistically fragile, the reported effect size is likely an overestimation, and the study was underpowered. While the simple correlational analysis is a positive factor, the very weak primary evidence makes a successful replication unlikely.
---
0.40
The primary concern for replication is the small sample size (N=31), which yields low statistical power and a wide confidence interval for the effect size. Consequently, the reported p-value is just below the .05 significance threshold, suggesting the medium-sized correlation (r=-.38) may be an overestimation due to sampling error. While the simple correlational analysis is a positive feature, the low power significantly reduces the probability of a successful replication.
---
0.38
The primary reason for the low predicted success rate is the small sample size (N=31), which offers low statistical power and makes the findings susceptible to sampling error. While the reported correlation is of medium size (r=-.38), the associated p-value is close to the significance threshold (p<.05), a combination that is often associated with replication difficulty and overestimated effects. Although the author is highly cited, this positive factor is unlikely to overcome the statistical fragility of a small-N correlational finding.
---
0.35
The low predicted success rate is primarily driven by the small sample size (N=31) and a p-value just below the conventional significance threshold of .05. These factors suggest the reported medium effect size (r = -.38) is likely an overestimate, and a well-powered replication would probably find a smaller, non-significant result. While the analysis is straightforward, the study's connection to social psychology, a subfield with historically lower replication rates, also slightly lowers confidence."

The primary concerns for replicability are the extremely small sample size (N=12) and the consequently suspect effect size (d=3.25). Such a small sample leads to unstable estimates, and the massive reported effect is likely a significant overestimation due to sampling error (a ""winner's curse""). Although the p‑value is very low, a replication with a more appropriately sized sample would likely observe a much smaller, and potentially non-significant, effect.

0.3
The primary concern is the extremely small sample size (N=12), which is highly prone to producing unstable and inflated results. While the reported effect size (d=3.25) is massive, such extreme values from tiny samples are often substantial overestimates of the true effect and rarely replicate. The use of complex fMRI methods, despite a simple statistical test, also introduces potential challenges for a direct replication.
---
0.30
The extremely small sample size (N=12) is a critical weakness, making the result highly susceptible to sampling error, even with a within‑subjects design. The reported effect size (d=3.25) is astronomically large and likely an overestimation due to the low statistical power (a “winner’s curse” effect). While the reported p-value is strong, the finding's stability is doubtful, and the underlying complexity of fMRI data analysis introduces further risk to replicability.

The primary concern is the extremely small sample size (n=12), which provides a highly unstable estimate of the effect and is prone to significant overestimation (winner's curse). While the reported t‑statistic is very high, suggesting a strong signal, this is undermined by a major inconsistency between the reported effect size and the test statistic. The complexity of fMRI analysis further increases the risk that this finding is not robust, despite the established author and the plausible hypothesis.

0.35
The extremely small sample size (N=12) is the primary concern, as it leads to unstable estimates and a high likelihood of an inflated effect size. While the reported effect size (d=3.25) and associated p-value are exceptionally strong, such a massive effect is suspect and unlikely to be observed again. The combination of a tiny sample, a complex fMRI methodology, and the study's basis in social psychology—a field with historically mixed replication rates—suggests a low probability of successful replication."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
The representation of visual information inside the focus of attention is more precise than the representation of information outside the focus of attention. We found that the visual system can compensate for the cost of withdrawing attention by pooling noisy local features and computing summary statistics. The location of an individual object is a local feature, whereas the center of mass of several objects (centroid) is a summary feature representing the mean object location. Three experiments showed that withdrawing attention degraded the representation of individual positions more than the representation of the centroid. It appears that information outside the focus of attention can be represented at an abstract level that lacks local detail, but nevertheless carries a precise statistical summary of the scene. The term ensemble features refers to a broad class of statistical summary features that we propose collectively make up the representation of information outside the focus of attention.

Key details:
- Sample size: 8
- Analysis type (e.g. rm ANOVA, mixed ANOVA, regression, t‑test): dependent samples t-test
- Test statistic: t(7) = 2.76

The extremely small sample size (N=8) and a p-value just under the significance threshold (p=0.028) are strong predictors of replication failure, creating high statistical uncertainty. However, this is counterbalanced by a very large reported effect size and the fact that the authors demonstrated the finding across three separate experiments. While the true effect is likely smaller than reported, the presence of internal replication in a cognitive subfield known for robust effects suggests the finding will likely replicate.

0.35
The primary drivers for this low replication probability are the extremely small sample size (N=8) and a p-value (0.028) that is only narrowly significant. This combination indicates the study is severely underpowered, making the result highly susceptible to sampling error and suggesting the very large effect size is likely an overestimation. While the analysis is simple and the author is established, these factors are insufficient to overcome the weak statistical evidence.
---
0.35
This study has a low probability of replication primarily due to its extremely small sample size (N=8) and a p-value (0.028) that is just below the conventional significance threshold. While the reported effect size is very large, estimates from underpowered studies are often substantially inflated, meaning the true effect is likely smaller. The weak statistical evidence from this small sample outweighs other positive factors like the high author citations and simple analysis type.
---
0.32
The primary predictor of failure is the extremely small sample size (N=8), which yields very low statistical power and makes the findings unstable. This concern is amplified by a p-value of 0.028, which is only barely significant and falls in a range known to have lower replication rates. Although the reported effect size is very large, with such a small sample it is likely a substantial overestimation that would not be observed in a larger replication attempt.
---
0.45
The primary concern is the extremely small sample size (N=8), which yields a very imprecise and likely inflated effect size estimate, even though the reported effect is large. This low statistical power, combined with a p-value (0.028) that is close to the significance threshold, suggests the original finding may be fragile. These significant weaknesses likely outweigh the positive indicators, such as the simple analysis and a plausible effect within cognitive psychology."

The prediction for low replicability is driven primarily by the extremely small sample size (N=36), which yields unstable estimates and is prone to producing false positives. While the reported effect size is large (ηp² = .147) and the calculated p-value is just under the conventional threshold for significance (p ≈ .02), such findings are less trustworthy in underpowered studies. The study's subfield (social psychology) and its complex experimental manipulation (system threat) further contribute to the low predicted probability of successful replication.

0.15
The primary reason for the low replication probability is the extremely small sample size (N=36), which makes the study severely underpowered and the large effect size estimate (ηp²=0.147) likely inflated. Additionally, the calculated p-value of approximately .02 is only marginally significant, and the study's complex social-psychological manipulation (system threat) can be difficult to operationalize consistently, further reducing the chances of a successful replication.

0.25
The primary reason for the low replication probability is the extremely small sample size (N=36), which provides low statistical power and makes the findings highly unreliable. Although the reported effect size is large (ηp² = 0.147), in an underpowered study like this, it is likely to be a substantial overestimate, and the p-value (which is approximately .02 based on the F-statistic) is not strong enough to offset these concerns. Social psychology findings based on subtle manipulations and small samples have historically shown poor replicability.

The primary reason for the low replication probability is the extremely small sample size (N=36), which provides low statistical power and can produce unstable, inflated effect estimates. Furthermore, the reported F-statistic corresponds to a p-value of approximately .02, which is close to the conventional significance threshold and often associated with lower replication rates. The social psychology topic, involving a subtle manipulation of belief systems, also suggests the effect may be highly context-dependent and difficult to reproduce.
---
0.25
The predicted probability of replication success is low due to a convergence of several risk factors. The study's sample size (N=36) is extremely small for this type of design, which severely limits statistical power and suggests the large reported effect size is likely inflated. Furthermore, the resulting p-value (p ≈ .02) is not far from the significance threshold, and the study's topic is a subtle social manipulation within a subfield that has historically faced replication challenges."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
A photograph of an action can convey a vivid sense of motion. Does the inference of motion from viewing a photograph involve the same neural and psychological representations used when one views physical motion? In this study, we tested whether implied motion is represented by the same direction-selective signals involved in the perception of real motion. We made use of the motion aftereffect, a visual motion illusion. Three experiments showed that viewing a series of static photographs with implied motion in a particular direction produced motion aftereffects in the opposite direction, as assessed with real-motion test probes. The transfer of adaptation from motion depicted in photographs to real motion demonstrates that the perception of implied motion activates direction-selective circuits that are also involved in processing real motion.

Key details:
- Sample size: 29
- Analysis type (e.g. rm ANOVA, mixed ANOVA, regression, t‑test): paired sample t-test
- Test statistic: t(28) = -4.978
- Reported p‑value: 0.00003
- Effect size (e.g. Cohen’s d, r): d = -.94
- First author’s citation count: 2029
- Subfield: Cognitive, Social

Note:
Some subfields—such as social or developmental psychology—have historically shown lower replication rates compared to others like clinical or personality psychology, though individual study quality still matters.",0.94,0.92,0.92,0.92,0.92,0.924,"0.94
The probability of replication is high due to the combination of a very strong effect size (d = -0.94) and a highly significant p-value (p < .0001). Although the sample size (N=29) is relatively small, the study uses a simple analysis for a well-controlled perceptual experiment, and the sheer magnitude of the effect suggests it is a robust phenomenon. The finding is based on a foundational visual illusion, which tends to yield more replicable results than more complex social phenomena.
---
0.92
This prediction is high due to the combination of a very small p-value and a large effect size (d = -0.94), which indicates a strong and clear finding. The use of a simple paired t-test and a within-subjects design makes the result less susceptible to analytical error and powerful even with a modest sample size. Additionally, basic cognitive perception effects, such as this motion illusion, historically have high replication rates.
---
0.92
This study has a very high probability of replication due to its extremely low p-value and large effect size (d = -0.94). The simple analysis (paired t-test) within a powerful within-subjects design minimizes analytical flexibility and suggests the finding is statistically robust. While the sample size is modest, the strength of the reported effect indicates it should be readily detectable in a replication attempt.
---
0.92
The prediction for high replication success is based on the combination of a very small p-value and a large effect size (d = -0.94), suggesting a robust finding. This confidence is bolstered by a simple, standard analysis (paired t-test) and a powerful within-subjects experimental design. Studies in cognitive perception, especially those based on classic, strong phenomena like the motion aftereffect, tend to have high replicability.
---
0.92
The prediction is high due to the combination of a very strong p‑value (p < .0001) and a large effect size (d = ‑0.94), which are both powerful predictors of replication success. While the sample size is modest, the study uses a powerful within‑subjects design with a simple, standard analysis (paired t‑test). The finding is also grounded in a robust perceptual illusion, making it less likely to be dependent on subtle contextual factors that can hinder replication."

The probability of replication is very low due to the extremely small sample size (N=28), which is insufficient for a complex mixed ANOVA design and leads to unstable estimates. The reported F-statistic corresponds to a p-value of .051, which is not statistically significant and was obscured by reporting the outdated `prep` metric. Complex interaction effects found in underpowered studies are notoriously difficult to replicate, and the large reported effect size is likely an inflation.
---
0.22
The prediction is low primarily due to the very small sample size (N=28), which provides low statistical power and unstable estimates for a complex mixed ANOVA design. The test statistic corresponds to a p-value of approximately .05, which is a borderline result suggesting the evidence is weak and may not be robust. Although the reported effect size is large, it is likely an overestimation, a common issue in small, underpowered studies that find a ""significant"" result.
---
0.15
This prediction is low due to the very small sample size (N=28), which provides insufficient statistical power and produces unreliable estimates for a mixed-design study. The reported F-statistic is only marginally significant (p≈.051), and the key finding is a complex interaction effect, which is often difficult to replicate. Additionally, the unusual reporting of a `prep` value instead of a standard p-value is a strong indicator of a fragile result.
---
0.15
The predicted probability of replication is very low due to multiple critical weaknesses. The sample size (N=28) is extremely small for testing a complex interaction, resulting in low statistical power. Furthermore, the reported test statistic F(1, 26) = 4.17 corresponds to a p‑value of .051, which fails to meet the conventional threshold for significance, and the use of the discredited ""prep"" statistic is a major red flag. These factors, combined with the complexity of the three-way interaction finding, make a successful replication highly unlikely.
---
0.15
This study has a very low probability of replication due to a confluence of major statistical red flags. The sample size (N=28) is extremely small, meaning the study is severely underpowered and the large reported effect size is likely an overestimate. Most importantly, the reported test statistic corresponds to a p-value of approximately .051, which is not significant, and the use of the discredited *p*<sub>rep</sub> metric suggests an attempt to obscure this marginal finding."

The primary concern is the very small sample size (N=25), which significantly increases the risk of an unstable and overestimated result. While the reported p-value is low and the effect size is large, such findings in underpowered studies are often inflated and may not be robust. The complexity of the eye-tracking paradigm and the specific social stimuli may also pose challenges for a direct and successful replication.

The very small sample size (N=25) is a major concern, as underpowered studies are prone to producing inflated effect sizes that are difficult to replicate. Although the p-value is low (<.005) and the effect size is large (ηp²=.18), this combination in a small sample is a classic indicator of the ""winner's curse,"" suggesting the true effect is likely much smaller. The study's focus on a subtle social cognition phenomenon, a subfield with historically mixed replication success, further lowers the probability of a successful replication.

The primary concern is the very small sample size (N=25), which makes the study underpowered and highly susceptible to finding an inflated effect size or a false positive. While the low p‑value (<.005) and large effect size (__p^2 = .18) are positive signals, such strong results from a small sample are often not robust. The complex mixed ANOVA analysis also introduces researcher flexibility that can reduce replicability, despite the study's controlled experimental design.

0.25
The extremely small sample size (N=25) is a major concern, as it increases the likelihood of an overestimated effect size. Indeed, the reported partial eta-squared of .18 is very large and likely inflated, a common issue in underpowered studies that can lead to replication failure. Although the p-value is strong, it is a direct consequence of this large effect and may not be robust in a new, larger sample.
---
0.35
The primary reason for this low prediction is the very small sample size (N=25), which provides low statistical power and suggests the large reported effect size is likely inflated. While the p-value is strong (p<.005), this is insufficient to overcome the high risk of a false positive associated with the small sample and the study's origin in social psychology, a subfield with historically lower replication rates."

The prediction is moderate due to competing factors. While the reported effect size is very large (ηp² = .20) and the within‑subjects design is powerful, the finding's stability is questionable. The very small sample size (N=24) and a p-value just under the conventional significance threshold (p≈.025) suggest the reported effect may be inflated and a replication could fail to reach significance.
---
0.45
The prediction is low due to a combination of a very small sample size (N=24) and a p-value (calculated as p ≈ .026 from the F-statistic) that is just barely significant. While the reported effect size is large, such estimates are often inflated in small, underpowered studies, meaning the true effect is likely smaller. Therefore, a direct replication has a substantial chance of yielding a non-significant result due to this likely overestimation and low statistical power.
---
0.55
The very small sample size (N=24) and a p-value that is likely just below the .05 threshold (an F‑statistic of 5.7 with these degrees of freedom yields p=.026) are strong indicators of fragility. While the reported effect size is large and the within-subjects design is powerful, these positive factors are undermined by the low statistical power, which increases the risk of both a false positive and an inflated effect size estimate upon which the finding rests.
---
0.45
The prediction is driven primarily by the very small sample size (N=24) and the corresponding weak statistical evidence. The reported F-statistic yields a p-value of approximately .025, which is fragile and close to the significance threshold, suggesting the large effect size may be an overestimate. While the first author is highly cited, the statistical weakness of this specific finding makes a successful replication less likely.
---
0.75
While the small sample size (N=24) and the corresponding p-value being significant but not overwhelmingly strong (p≈.025) are risk factors, the study has several strengths favoring replication. The within-subjects RM ANOVA design is powerful, the survival-based memory theory is plausible and has generated much research, and the large effect size (ηp²=.20) suggests a potent effect, even if likely inflated. Given these factors and the experienced author, a well-powered replication is likely to find a significant effect, albeit probably a smaller one."

The prediction is relatively low due to a combination of weak statistical evidence from the original study. The sample size is small for detecting the reported small effect size (pr = .21), which means the original study had low statistical power. Furthermore, the reported `prep` value corresponds to a p-value close to the conventional .05 threshold, and such ""just significant"" findings have demonstrated lower replication rates.

0.42
The prediction is low primarily due to the combination of a small sample size (N=119) and a small effect size (pr=.21), which indicates the original study had low statistical power. While the reported p-value is significant (the `prep` of .92 corresponds to a p-value of approximately .01), underpowered studies are more likely to report inflated effect sizes that are difficult to replicate. The experienced author is a positive sign, but it may not be enough to overcome the statistical weaknesses of the original finding.

0.45
This study's primary weakness is the combination of a small effect size (pr = .21) and a modest sample size (N = 119), which results in low statistical power and increases the chance that the original finding is an overestimate. While the result was statistically significant (the reported `prep` corresponds to a p-value of approximately .014), this p-value is not exceptionally strong. These statistical weaknesses suggest a substantial risk that a direct replication would fail to find a significant effect, despite the straightforward study design and experienced author.

0.25
This prediction is based on the combination of a small sample size (N=119) for a correlational study and a small reported effect size (pr=.21). Furthermore, the reported `prep` statistic corresponds to a p-value just under the conventional .05 significance threshold, a value range that has been shown to have a low replication rate. These factors suggest the original finding is statistically fragile and likely an overestimate of the true effect, thus making a successful replication unlikely.

The prediction is driven by the combination of a small sample size (N=119) and a small effect size (pr = .21), which results in low statistical power. While the reported result was significant (inferred p-value of ~.01), studies with low power are susceptible to inflated effect size estimates, making a successful replication challenging. The study's origin in social psychology, a subfield with historically lower replication rates, also tempers the forecast."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
People are able to explicitly resist using knowledge about one person to evaluate another person from the same group. After learning about positive and negative behaviors performed by one individual from each of two different groups, participants were introduced briefly to new individuals from the groups. Implicit evaluations of the original individuals readily generalized to the new individuals; explicitly, participants resisted such generalization. Days later, both implicit and explicit evaluations of the original individuals generalized to the new individuals. The results suggest that associative links (e.g., shared group membership) are sufficient for implicit attitude generalization, but deliberative logic (e.g., individual group members are not necessarily the same) can reduce explicit generalization by association. When knowledge distinguishing who did what is unavailable, such as after forgetting, associative knowledge provides the basis of explicit evaluation. We conclude that a simple association linking one individual to another can produce implicit attitude generalization immediately and explicit attitude generalization eventually.

Despite the very large sample size, the reported test statistic (t = ‑0.11) and effect size (d = ‑.004) are both extremely close to zero, indicating a clear null finding in the original study. Since this well‑powered study found a result that was not statistically significant, a replication is highly unlikely to find an effect that meets the conventional threshold for success (p < .05). The original finding is a precisely estimated null effect, which a replication would likely confirm.

0.01
The original study reported a near-zero effect size (d = -0.004) and a highly non-significant result, as indicated by the very small t-statistic (t = -0.11). Even with a large sample size that provides high statistical power, no meaningful effect was found for this specific test. Therefore, it is extremely unlikely that a direct replication of this particular analysis would yield a statistically significant result.
---
0.05
The reported effect size (d = -0.004) and test statistic (t = -0.11) are both extremely close to zero, indicating a null result. This finding is particularly convincing because it comes from a very large sample (N = 564), which would have had high statistical power to detect even a small effect if one existed. Therefore, a successful replication that finds a significant effect is highly improbable.
---
0.05
The primary reason for this low prediction is the original study's own statistical results, which strongly indicate a null finding for this specific test. Despite a very large sample size, the test statistic (t = -0.11) and effect size (d = -0.004) are both negligibly different from zero. A successful replication is therefore highly likely to also find a null effect, meaning the chance of achieving a statistically significant result (p < .05) is extremely low.
---
0.1
A successful replication is highly unlikely due to the original study's extremely weak evidence. Despite a very large sample size (N=564), the effect size was functionally zero (d = -.004) and the test statistic was non-significant (t = -0.11). The large sample provides high confidence that the true effect is negligible, meaning a replication is very likely to also produce a null result."

The very small sample size (N=30) makes the findings highly susceptible to sampling error and instability, casting doubt on the robustness of the result. Consequently, the reported large effect size (d=.88) is likely inflated, a common issue in underpowered studies. While the p‑value is strong, social priming effects like this have a history of failing to replicate, suggesting a low probability of success in a new, independent study.

0.20
The study's primary weakness is its very small sample size (N=30), which makes it severely underpowered and suggests the large reported effect size is likely inflated due to the ""winner's curse."" Additionally, the research falls into the subfield of social psychology, and the paradigm—using a brief text to prime a belief and influence subsequent complex behavior—is a type of finding that has historically proven difficult to replicate. While the p-value is significant, these severe methodological and contextual limitations indicate a low probability of successful replication.
---
0.25
The primary reason for the low predicted success is the extremely small sample size (N=30), which makes the finding highly susceptible to sampling error and suggests the very large effect size is likely an overestimation. Furthermore, the study uses a social priming paradigm to influence complex behavior (cheating), a type of finding that has historically demonstrated low rates of replicability. The simple analysis is a positive factor, but it is heavily outweighed by the small sample and the nature of the effect being tested.
---
0.30
The extremely small sample size (N=30) makes the study severely underpowered, suggesting the very large reported effect size is likely an overestimation and the finding has low statistical certainty. Furthermore, studies on behavioral priming in social psychology, where a subtle manipulation is claimed to affect complex behavior, have historically shown low rates of successful replication. These factors indicate a low probability of replication, despite the highly cited author and simple analysis.
---
0.15
The prediction is low due to the combination of a very small sample size (N=30) and an extremely large effect size (d=.88), which suggests the original finding is likely overestimated and the study was underpowered. Furthermore, conceptual priming studies from social psychology have historically low replication rates, and this type of subtle manipulation is often difficult to reproduce. While the p-value is significant, this is less informative given the other major methodological concerns."

The primary concern is the extremely small sample size (N=4), which makes the results highly unstable and susceptible to being driven by idiosyncratic individuals. Although the p-value is very low and the effect size is massive (η² = .74), these strong metrics from such a tiny sample are likely to be substantial overestimates of the true effect. While the study is in a typically robust subfield (cognitive perception), the statistical foundation is too fragile to expect a successful replication with high confidence.

The primary factor reducing the likelihood of replication is the extremely small sample size of four participants. Although the reported p-value is low (p = .005) and the effect size is very large (η² = .74), such extreme results from a tiny sample are highly susceptible to sampling error and are likely significant overestimates of the true effect. A replication with a more robust sample would probably find a much smaller effect, which may no longer be statistically significant.

0.45
While the reported p-value is very low (0.005) and the effect size is extremely large (η² = .74), the sample size of only four participants is a critical methodological flaw. Such a small sample produces highly unstable results and inflated effect size estimates, which may not be representative of the broader population. This extreme lack of statistical power makes the finding very susceptible to being a Type I error, substantially lowering its probability of replication.

0.25
The primary reason for this low prediction is the extremely small sample size of 4 participants. While the reported p-value is low and the effect size is very large, findings from such a tiny sample are highly unreliable, statistically underpowered, and prone to massive overestimation of the true effect. Results are likely driven by the idiosyncratic performance of one or two individuals and are unlikely to generalize to a new sample.

This study reports a very low p-value (0.005) and a massive effect size (η² = .74), which are strong positive predictors of replication. The study's focus on a basic auditory perception task within cognitive psychology also suggests a potentially robust effect. However, the extremely small sample size (N=4) is a major weakness, suggesting the reported effect size is likely inflated and the result could be unstable."

The small sample size (N=84 for a three-group design) is a significant concern, as it can produce unstable results and inflated effect sizes. While the reported effect size (ηp² =.11) is large, such findings in small samples are often overestimated and fail to replicate. The study falls within the subfield of social/cognitive priming, which has a known history of replication challenges for subtle experimental manipulations.
---
0.25
The small sample size (N=84) provides low statistical power and suggests the reported medium-to-large effect size may be an overestimation. The corresponding p-value (approx. .01, based on the F-statistic) is not overwhelmingly strong, increasing the chance of a false positive. Finally, subtle priming effects within social cognition have historically proven difficult to replicate successfully, which lowers confidence in this particular finding.
---
0.25
This prediction is low due to several risk factors characteristic of findings that later fail to replicate. The sample size is small for a between-subjects design, which makes the large reported effect size (ηp² = .11) likely to be an inflation of the true effect. Most importantly, the study employs a subtle priming manipulation to influence complex social and cognitive judgments, a paradigm from a subfield with a well-documented history of low replicability.
---
0.22
This prediction is low primarily due to the small sample size (N=84) and the study's subfield of social priming, an area known for low replication rates. Although the reported effect size is large (ηp² = .11) and the implied p-value is significant, such findings from small samples are often inflated and less likely to replicate in higher-powered, pre-registered attempts. The subtle and surprising nature of the effect—priming distance by plotting points to influence emotion and judgment—is characteristic of many findings that have historically struggled to replicate.
---
0.22
The prediction is low due to the combination of a small sample size (N=84) and a very large reported effect size (ηp²=.11) for a subtle priming manipulation, which suggests a high risk of effect inflation. Furthermore, studies in the social priming subfield, which often feature abstract, counter-intuitive mechanisms, have a well-documented history of low replication rates. These concerns outweigh the reported p-value and suggest a low probability of a successful replication."

The reported F-statistic is exceptionally large for the given sample size, which implies a massive and highly reliable effect that is very likely to be replicated. While the sample is of moderate size, the study uses a powerful repeated-measures ANOVA design, and the resulting p-value is highly significant. These strong statistical signals, combined with the established author, suggest a robust finding.

The prediction for a high likelihood of replication is driven primarily by the exceptionally strong statistical evidence; an F-statistic of 192.89 with a corresponding p-value of <.001 suggests a very large and robust effect that is highly unlikely to be a chance finding. While the social psychology context and moderate sample size (N=82) can sometimes be risk factors, the sheer magnitude of the reported effect should make it readily detectable in a direct replication. The experienced lead author further increases confidence in the quality of the original study's design.

This prediction is high due to the extremely strong statistical evidence reported. The F-value of 192.89 is exceptionally large, implying a massive effect size that should be easy to detect even with the modest sample size of 82 participants in a repeated-measures design. This strong signal, corroborated by a p-value <.001 and an established author, suggests the finding is robust and has a high likelihood of successful replication.

The reported p-value is very low (<.001) and the F-statistic is exceptionally large, implying a massive effect that should replicate easily. However, an effect of this magnitude is highly unusual for this type of research, raising concerns that the result may be an artifact of the specific procedure or a statistical error. While the experienced author and controlled design are positives, this ""too good to be true"" statistical result warrants some skepticism, leading to a moderately high replication prediction.

0.92
The study reports an exceptionally large F-statistic and a correspondingly low p-value (<.001), which implies a very large effect that is highly likely to be robust. Although the sample size is only moderate and social psychology has shown lower replication rates, the sheer magnitude of the statistical evidence for this specific finding suggests it would successfully replicate. The analysis is standard and the experimental design appears well-controlled, further increasing confidence."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
People are motivated to maintain social connection with others, and those who lack social connection with other humans may try to compensate by creating a sense of human connection with nonhuman agents.

The primary concern is the small sample size (N=57), which provides low statistical power for a mixed ANOVA design and can produce unstable estimates. Although the reported p‑value is significant (p=0.01) and the effect size is large (η²=.12), such findings in small studies are often inflated and less likely to replicate in a better‑powered study. The subfield of social psychology, particularly research on induced psychological states, has also historically faced challenges with replicability.
---
0.35
The primary concerns are the small sample size (N=57) and a p-value (p=.01) that is statistically significant but not highly robust, increasing the risk of a false positive. While the reported effect size is medium-to-large, such estimates are often inflated in underpowered studies common in social psychology. These factors, combined with a complex mixed ANOVA design, suggest the original result may not be robust.
---
0.35
The low sample size (N=57) provides insufficient statistical power and increases the likelihood that the reported large effect size is inflated. While the p‑value is significant, it is not exceptionally low, and the use of a complex mixed ANOVA introduces analytical flexibility that can make precise replication difficult. These factors combined suggest a modest probability of successful replication.
---
0.35
The primary concern is the very small sample size (N=57) for a mixed ANOVA, which suggests the study was underpowered and that the reported medium-to-large effect size (η²=.12) is likely inflated. The p-value of .01, while statistically significant, is not overwhelmingly strong and falls in a range that has been associated with lower replicability rates. Although the first author is highly cited, these statistical weaknesses, combined with the study's subfield (social psychology), suggest a low probability of a successful replication.
---
0.35
The primary concern is the very small sample size (N=57), which suggests the study was underpowered and the large reported effect size (η² = .12) is likely an overestimation. Findings from small-sample studies, particularly in social psychology which has a history of lower replication rates, often fail to replicate in larger, more robust follow-ups. While the p‑value is below .05, it is not strong enough to overcome the statistical weakness of the small sample."

This prediction is high due to the exceptionally large reported effect size (ηp² = .59) and the corresponding high F-statistic, which suggests a very strong and robust phenomenon. A finding this powerful, supported by a decent sample size for a lab study, is highly likely to be detected again in a direct replication. The simple analysis and the established nature of the underlying concept (in-group favoritism) further increase confidence in its replicability.

The prediction is high due to the exceptionally strong evidence presented in the original study. The combination of a large sample size, a very low p-value (p<0.001), and an extremely large effect size (η_p^2 = .59) strongly suggests a robust finding that is not a statistical artifact. While the study introduces a new paradigm, an effect of this magnitude should be readily detectable even with minor procedural variations in a replication attempt.

The prediction for high replicability is driven by the exceptionally strong evidence for the effect, including a very large F‑statistic and a very large effect size (ηp^2 = .59). These factors, combined with a large sample size and a simple statistical analysis, suggest a robust finding that should be readily observable in a new sample. While social psychology has a mixed replication record, the powerful and clear-cut nature of these results indicates a high likelihood of success.

This prediction is high due to the exceptionally strong statistical evidence, including an extremely low p‑value and a very large effect size (ηp^2 = .59). The study's large sample size (N=240) further increases confidence in the stability of the result. While new experimental paradigms can sometimes be difficult to replicate, the sheer magnitude of the reported effect suggests it is a robust phenomenon that is likely to be reproduced.

This study has a very high probability of replication due to its exceptionally large effect size (ηp² = .59) and the corresponding, highly significant p-value (p < .001). The large sample size (N=240) provides ample statistical power, and the straightforward analysis (equivalent to a t-test) minimizes ambiguity. While social psychology studies can have lower replication rates, the sheer magnitude of the reported effect strongly suggests a robust phenomenon that should be readily observable in a new sample."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
Word-order rules impose major constraints on linguistic behavior. For example, adjectives appear before nouns in English, and after nouns in French. This means that constraints on word order must be language-specific properties upheld on-line by the language system. Despite the importance of these rules, little is known about how they operate. We report an influence of word order on the activation of phonological representations. Participants were presented with colored objects and asked to name either the colors or the objects; the phonological similarity between the object and color names was manipulated. French speakers showed a phonological congruency effect in color naming, but not in object naming. English participants yielded the opposite pattern: a phonological effect in object naming, but not in color naming. Differences in the typical order of nouns and adjectives in French and English provide a plausible account for this cross-linguistic contrast. More generally, these results provide direct evidence for the operation of word-order constraints during language production.

This prediction is low primarily due to the combination of an extremely small sample size (N=15) and a very large effect size (d=1.71). Such a large effect from a tiny sample is a classic sign of effect size inflation, meaning the true effect is likely much smaller and the original finding may have been a statistical fluke. While the p-value is low, the result's stability is highly questionable and unlikely to be replicated with the same magnitude in a larger, more robust study.
---
0.35
This prediction is low primarily due to the extremely small sample size (n=15), which increases the likelihood of a spurious result and leads to a massively inflated effect size estimate (d=1.71). Although the reported p-value is low (<.007), such a large effect is highly suspect and likely to shrink or disappear in a higher-powered replication. The study’s reliance on a cross-linguistic interaction effect also presents a higher barrier for successful replication compared to a simple main effect.
---
0.35
The primary concern for replication is the extremely small sample size (N=15), which often produces unstable results and highly inflated effect size estimates. While the reported p-value is strong and the effect size (d=1.71) is massive, such ""too good to be true"" results from underpowered studies frequently fail to replicate. A larger, more robust replication study would likely find a much smaller effect that may not meet the threshold for statistical significance.
---
0.45
While the reported p-value is low, the finding is based on an extremely small sample size (N=15) that produces a very large but likely overestimated effect size. Small-N studies that find significant results are often not robust, and a well-powered replication would likely observe a much smaller effect that may not reach statistical significance. The true finding of interest is a cross-linguistic interaction, which is more difficult to replicate than the reported simple t-test.
---
0.35
The primary reason for this low prediction is the extremely small sample size (N=15), which makes the results highly susceptible to random sampling error and instability. Consequently, the reported effect size (d=1.71) is massive and very likely an overestimation; such large effects are rare and often shrink dramatically in replications with larger samples. While the p-value is strong, it is a direct consequence of this inflated effect size and does not guarantee the finding's robustness."

This prediction is low primarily because the study's topic—ovulatory shifts in mate preference—comes from a subfield of evolutionary psychology with a well-documented history of failed replications. Although the sample size is moderate and the p-value is significant, the effect size is small-to-medium and the complex interaction effect is less likely to be robust than a simple main effect. These factors combined suggest that the original finding was likely a statistical artifact or is much smaller and more context-dependent than reported, making a direct replication unlikely to succeed.

The study’s core “ovulatory shift” hypothesis comes from a subfield of evolutionary psychology with a well-documented replication crisis, where larger studies have consistently failed to reproduce earlier findings. The reported effect size is small (f = 0.19) and the finding relies on a complex interaction, both of which decrease the likelihood of a successful replication. The p-value, while statistically significant, is not extreme enough to outweigh these substantial concerns.

This prediction is low primarily because this type of evolutionary psychology finding, concerning mate preference shifts with fertility, has a very poor track record in large-scale replication attempts. Furthermore, the small effect size (f = 0.19) and a p-value that is not overwhelmingly strong (p = .008) for a complex interaction effect suggest a high risk that the original finding was a false positive.

This study reports on an ""ovulatory shift"" hypothesis, a research area within evolutionary psychology that has a poor track record of successful replication. While the sample size is decent and the p-value is significant, the effect size is small (f=0.19) and the finding is a complex interaction that could be fragile and difficult to reproduce. The combination of a controversial hypothesis, a small effect, and a complex design makes a successful replication unlikely.

The probability of successful replication is low due to a small-to-moderate effect size (f = 0.19) and the study's subject matter. Research on ovulatory cycle shifts influencing mate preference has a well-documented history of failing to replicate, suggesting that the original effects were likely overestimated or the result of methodological artifacts. The complex interaction effect reported here is particularly vulnerable to such issues and would require a very large, pre-registered study to be convincingly demonstrated.

Although the p-value is strong (p = .008), the effect size is small (f = 0.19), and complex interactions like the one tested are often less robust than simpler effects. These factors combined suggest that the original finding may be difficult to reproduce consistently.

This prediction is low primarily because research linking menstrual cycle shifts to complex social judgments has a very poor replication record. While the p-value is below the standard threshold, the reported effect size is small (f = 0.19), indicating that the finding may not be robust or could be an overestimation. The complexity of the predicted interaction (woman's fertility x woman's relationship status x man's status) further increases the likelihood that the original result was a statistical artifact.

The study tests an ovulatory shift hypothesis, a research area in social psychology known for very low replication rates. The finding itself is a complex interaction with a small-to-medium effect size (f=0.19), which is difficult to detect reliably and suggests the original sample (N=208) was likely underpowered. These factors, combined with a p-value that is significant but not overwhelmingly so, make a successful replication highly improbable."

Some subfields—such as social or developmental psychology—have historically shown lower replication rates compared to others like clinical or personality psychology, though individual study quality still matters.",0.45,0.35,0.65,0.82,0.55,0.564,"0.45
While the reported effect size is very large (ηp² = .52) and the corresponding p-value is low, the extremely small sample size (N=14) is a major red flag. Such a small sample provides a very noisy estimate, meaning the huge reported effect is likely an overestimation due to sampling error. An independent replication with a more appropriately powered sample would likely find a much smaller effect, if any, creating a substantial risk of failure.
---
0.35
While the reported statistics appear strong (a large effect size of ηp² = 0.522 and a low p-value implied by the F-statistic), the extremely small sample size (N=14) makes this result highly suspect. Small samples can lead to inflated effect sizes and are prone to sampling error, meaning the finding is unstable. A well-powered, independent replication would likely observe a smaller effect, reducing the probability of achieving statistical significance.
---
0.65
The very small sample size (N=14) is a primary concern, as findings from such studies can be unstable and effect sizes prone to overestimation. However, the reported effect is exceptionally large (ηp² = 0.522) and the p‑value is highly significant, indicating a strong signal that is likely to be detected again, even if its true magnitude is smaller. The controlled nature of a lab-based visual search task further increases the probability of a successful replication.
---
0.82
The prediction is high due to the exceptionally large effect size (partial η² = 0.522) and the correspondingly very low p‑value (p ≈ .002), which suggest a robust phenomenon. While the sample size is very small (N=14), which is a significant weakness, finding such a strong signal in a small sample can still be compelling evidence. The study’s grounding in cognitive psychology, which often has higher replication rates for perceptual tasks, also supports a successful replication.
---
0.55
While the reported result is highly significant (p≈.002) with a very large effect size, the extremely small sample (N=14) is a major weakness. Small samples produce unstable results and are known to inflate effect size estimates due to a “winner’s curse.” Therefore, the true effect is likely much smaller than reported, casting significant doubt on whether a replication would successfully find a significant result."

The primary reasons for this low prediction are the very small sample size and the study's subfield. A sample of 43 participants in a between-subjects design offers low statistical power, making the original result less stable and the large reported effect size likely an overestimate. Furthermore, findings in social psychology related to priming and embodied cognition have famously low replication rates, and this specific effect is known to be difficult to reproduce.
---
0.15
The study’s very small sample size (N=43) makes it severely underpowered, which inflates the reported large effect size and makes the significant p-value less trustworthy. Furthermore, the finding is a social priming effect (the “Macbeth effect”), a type of result from a subfield that has a well-documented history of replication failures. These factors combine to suggest a very low probability of successful replication in a well-powered, independent study.
---
0.15
This prediction for low replicability is based on several key indicators. The very small sample size (N=43) makes the study statistically underpowered and the results less stable, while the reported effect size (ηp² = .16) is extremely large and thus likely inflated, a common issue in small studies. Furthermore, the study falls into the subfield of social priming, an area of psychology that has a well-documented history of findings that have failed to replicate in larger, pre-registered studies.
---
0.15
This study has a very low probability of replication success. The primary concerns are the extremely small sample size (N=43) for a between-subjects design and the correspondingly large, likely inflated, effect size (ηp² = .16). Furthermore, social psychology studies involving subtle priming manipulations, such as this one on cleanliness and morality, have a documented history of failing to replicate in larger, more rigorous subsequent attempts.
---
0.15
The prediction is low due to several risk factors. The sample size (N=43) is very small for a between-subjects design, which increases the likelihood of a false positive and effect size inflation. The reported effect size (ηp² = .16) is implausibly large for a subtle social priming manipulation, and this subfield has historically low replication rates."

This study has a very high probability of replication despite the extremely small sample size. The key indicator is the massive effect size (d = 1.573) and the correspondingly small p-value, which suggest a powerful and non-spurious perceptual phenomenon. Such strong effects in basic cognitive psychology (vision science) are often highly robust and consistent across individuals, making the small sample a lesser concern than it would be in other subfields.

This study has a very high probability of replication despite the extremely small sample size. The massive reported effect size (d=1.573) and corresponding low p-value (p<.001) suggest a powerful and consistent perceptual phenomenon that does not require a large sample to be reliably detected. Studies in cognitive perception, particularly on fundamental visual cues, often have high replication rates, and the simple t-test analysis minimizes the risk of unreplicable complexity.
---
0.88
This prediction is high primarily because of the extremely large reported effect size (d=1.573) and a very low p-value, which suggest a powerful and statistically robust finding. While the sample size of 8 is very small and typically a major risk factor, strong perceptual effects like the one described can often be reliably demonstrated in nearly all observers, making the small sample less of a fatal flaw. The simple analysis (single sample t-test) also reduces concerns about questionable research practices.
---
0.85
Although the sample size of eight is extremely small, several other indicators point towards successful replication. The reported p-value is very low (<.001) and the effect size is massive (d=1.573), which is plausible for a low-level visual perception study where effects are often robust. The simple analysis (t-test) and highly cited first author further suggest that this strong, clearly-demonstrated effect would likely be found again.
---
0.91
The prediction is high due to the exceptionally large reported effect size (d = 1.573) and the correspondingly small p‑value, suggesting a very strong phenomenon. While the sample size is extremely small, this is less concerning in basic perception studies where inter‑subject variability is often low and effects are robust. The simple analysis in a highly controlled experimental domain makes the finding very likely to replicate successfully."

The probability of replication is high due to a strong combination of factors. The sample size of 70 is large for a country-level analysis, and the moderate effect size (r = -0.43) is highly significant (p < .001), making a chance finding unlikely. The straightforward correlational analysis is transparent and easy to reproduce, further increasing confidence in the stability of the result.

This finding has a high probability of replication due to several strong factors. The study reports a medium-to-large effect size (r = -0.43) with a large sample for this type of cross-national research (N=70), which implies a very low p-value and high statistical power. The use of a simple correlational analysis and the first author's very high citation count further suggest a robust and reliable result.

This prediction is high due to a combination of favorable factors. The study uses a simple correlational analysis on a large sample for this type of research (N=70 countries), yielding a moderate effect size (r = -0.43) that is not borderline significant (p < .001). The finding is also grounded in a strong, well-established methodological critique (the reference-group effect), and the high citation count of the first author suggests a well-vetted study, all of which point to a high likelihood of replication.

The prediction is high due to a robust effect size (r = -0.43) combined with a sufficient sample size for a country-level study (N=70), yielding a highly significant p-value. The straightforward correlational analysis and the first author's extensive experience further increase confidence in the finding's stability. While country-level data can be complex to gather, the statistical evidence for this specific correlation is strong.

The prediction is high due to strong statistical evidence, including a large effect size (r = -0.43) and a substantial sample size (N=70) for a country-level correlational study, which implies a very low p-value.

This prediction is low due to the combination of a small sample size (N=53) and a p-value just below the .05 significance threshold for a small-to-medium effect. Findings from statistically underpowered studies often inflate the true effect size and are less likely to replicate, especially for subtle social-cognitive phenomena. The reported correlation of r = -.31 is therefore likely to be smaller and potentially non-significant in a higher-powered replication attempt.

The predicted likelihood of replication is low due to a combination of a small sample size (N=53) and a p-value reported as just below the conventional significance threshold (p < .05). Such marginally significant results from underpowered studies are often not robust, and the reported effect size (r = -.31) may be an overestimate. While the analysis is straightforward, the combination of low statistical power and a minimal p-value makes the original finding highly susceptible to sampling error and less likely to replicate.
---
0.25
The study's low sample size (N=53) and a p-value reported as just under the .05 threshold suggest the finding is statistically fragile and at high risk of being a false positive. While the reported effect size (r=-.31) is moderate, such effects are often inflated in small samples and may shrink or disappear in a higher-powered replication. The study's topic, linking a personality trait to a subtle cognitive bias, is also characteristic of social cognition research that has historically faced replication challenges.

The primary concerns are the small sample size (N=53) and the p-value reported as just below the .05 threshold. Such ""just significant"" results from underpowered studies are less likely to replicate, and the reported effect size (r=-.31) is likely an overestimation of the true effect. While the correlation analysis is straightforward, the study's finding linking a personality trait to a subtle cognitive bias may be sensitive to specific experimental contexts, further lowering confidence.

158,Conflict-triggered goal shielding: Response conflicts attenuate background monitoring for prospective memory cues.,"T Goschke, G Dreisbach","F(1, 38) = 6.21",prep = .927,ANOVA,interaction,__p^2 = .14,40,4017,"F(1, 93)=18.94",95,3.50E-05,yes,"Action control in a changing environment requires that one shield current goals from distracting information (goal shielding) and at the same time monitor the environment for potentially significant stimuli that may afford a goal switch (background monitoring). Response conflicts modulate the balance between goal shielding and background monitoring, as indicated by reduced susceptibility to interference after response conflicts. Such conflict-adaptation effects have been attributed to enhanced recruitment of cognitive control on trials following conflicts.

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
Action control in a changing environment requires that one shield current goals from distracting information (goal shielding) and at the same time monitor the environment for potentially significant stimuli that may afford a goal switch (background monitoring).

The prediction is driven primarily by the large reported effect size (ηp² = .14), which suggests a robust phenomenon. This is tempered by a modest sample size (N=40) and a p-value (~.017, calculated from the F-statistic) that is significant but not exceptionally small, increasing replication uncertainty. However, the use of a controlled cognitive experiment with a likely within-subjects design adds to the study's potential replicability.

0.82
The prediction is high due to the reported large effect size (ηp² = .14), which suggests a robust phenomenon that is less likely to be a statistical fluke. While the sample size (N=40) is not large, it is adequate for the within-subjects design implied by the analysis, and the resulting p-value (p≈.017, derived from the F-statistic) indicates a reasonably strong signal. The use of a standard, well-controlled cognitive paradigm also favors successful replication.
---
0.85
This prediction is high due to the large reported effect size (__p^2 = .14) and a p-value well below the standard threshold (p ≈ .017, as calculated from the F-statistic). Although the sample size (N=40) is modest, it is sufficient to provide high statistical power for an effect of this magnitude, especially in the implied within-subjects design. The use of a standard cognitive paradigm with a straightforward and internally consistent ANOVA further increases confidence that the finding is robust.

This study has a high probability of successful replication due to several strong characteristics. The reported effect size is large (ηp² = .14) and the p-value is solid (p ≈ .017, derived from the F-statistic), both of which are key predictors of replicability. Additionally, the sample size (N=40) is reasonable for a within-subjects cognitive paradigm, and the high citation count of the first author suggests a well-established and methodologically sound lab.

The prediction is high due to the large reported effect size (η²p = .14), which is a strong indicator of replicability and suggests the study was well-powered. This is supported by the use of a standard, high-power within-subjects cognitive paradigm with a sufficient sample size. The primary source of uncertainty is the p-value (p≈.017, calculated from the F-statistic), which is significant but not overwhelmingly so, slightly tempering an otherwise very strong prediction."

The prediction for a high replication probability rests on the very large reported effect size (ηp² = .23) and the correspondingly strong test statistic and p-value. Although the sample size is relatively small, the effect is so pronounced that it would likely be detected even in a sample of this size. The use of a standard experimental paradigm (visual search) for a well-theorized effect (attentional bias to threat) further increases confidence in the finding's robustness.
---
0.85
The reported effect size is very large (ηp² = .23) and the p‑value is well below the standard .05 threshold, suggesting a robust finding. While the sample size of 48 is small for a between-subjects design, the strength of the reported effect and the plausibility of the evolutionary hypothesis make a successful replication likely. The straightforward ANOVA analysis also reduces concerns about methodological complexity influencing the result.
---
0.85
The prediction for successful replication is high due to the very large reported effect size (ηp² = .23) and a strong p-value (p < .01). Although the sample size is relatively small, the finding relies on a standard cognitive paradigm (visual search) with a straightforward statistical analysis (between ANOVA), which limits researcher flexibility and points to a robust phenomenon. The study's theoretically grounded hypothesis further increases confidence in the result.

The reported p-value is strong (<.01) and the effect size is large (ηp² = .23), suggesting a robust finding. While the sample size is relatively small, which can be a risk factor, the study describes a well-established attentional bias effect using a standard, simple experimental design (visual search task with ANOVA). The inclusion of three experiments in the original paper also implies internal replication, increasing the likelihood that the core finding is reliable.
---
0.82
This study has a high probability of replication primarily due to its very large reported effect size (ηp² = .23) and a correspondingly strong, non-borderline p‑value. While the sample size of 48 is modest and could lead to an overestimation of the true effect, the effect is so large that it would likely still be detected in a replication. Furthermore, the study uses a classic, highly-controlled cognitive psychology paradigm (visual search task) which is straightforward to reproduce, minimizing ambiguity in the methods."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
If people use the value of a class of stimuli heuristically to infer the frequency of the stimuli, they will assess more valuable stimulus classes as being less frequent even when value is not diagnostic of frequency. To test this hypothesis, we manipulated the value of stimuli only after participants had encoded them; then, participants assessed the frequencies of the stimuli. A randomization procedure ensured that stimulus value could not be diagnostic of frequency. We did not reveal these frequencies. Participants then learned that they would receive for each previously seen picture from one of the two categories (either birds or flowers). To determine the endowed category, respondents flipped a coin. Next, we asked them to estimate the number of pictures in each category. As predicted, participants were more likely to underestimate the number of flower pictures relative to bird pictures when they expected payment for flower pictures than when they expected payment for bird pictures. In contrast, they were more likely to underestimate the number of bird pictures relative to flower pictures when they expected payment for bird pictures than when they expected payment for flower pictures. Our results implicate a judgment process at the stimulus-retrieval stage, rather than at the encoding stage, because the value difference between the stimulus categories was induced randomly only after the stimuli were presented.

The study's primary weakness is its marginal statistical significance (p = .037) combined with a small sample size (N = 56), which are strong predictors of lower replicability and suggest the reported effect size may be inflated. While the experimental design seems sound and the analysis is simple (a Chi-squared test), the weak evidence makes it plausible that a well‑powered replication would find a smaller, non‑significant effect.

0.35
This prediction is low due to the combination of a small sample size (N=56) and a p-value (p=0.037) that is just barely below the conventional significance threshold of 0.05. Such a result has a high chance of being a false positive or an overestimation of the true effect, which would be difficult to detect in a replication attempt. While the analysis is simple and the effect size is medium, the weak statistical evidence is the overriding factor suggesting a low likelihood of successful replication.

This prediction is low due to the combination of a small sample size (N=56) and a p‑value (p=.037) that is only slightly below the standard .05 threshold. While the reported medium effect size and simple Chi-squared analysis are positive signs, the weak statistical evidence from an underpowered study suggests the original finding may be fragile and difficult to replicate. A well-powered replication would likely estimate a smaller, potentially non-significant effect.

This prediction is low primarily due to the combination of a small sample size (N=56) and a p‑value (p=.037) that is just below the conventional threshold for statistical significance. Such a ""barely significant"" p‑value from an underpowered study is a strong negative predictor of replicability, as it suggests the original result may be fragile or an overestimation of the true effect. Although the experimental design is sound, the weakness of the statistical evidence makes a successful replication less probable.

0.35
The primary reasons for this low prediction are the small sample size (N=56) and a p‑value (p=0.037) that is just barely below the conventional significance threshold. This combination suggests the result is statistically fragile and that the reported medium effect size may be an overestimate due to sampling error. The subfield of social psychology has also historically shown lower replication rates, which adds to the uncertainty."

The prediction is moderately optimistic due to strong internal replication across three experiments and a robust p-value (p≈.007, calculated from the F-statistic). However, the extremely small sample size (N=18) is a major weakness, suggesting the reported effect is likely inflated and would be smaller in a replication attempt. An inconsistency between the reported F-statistic and effect size also raises minor concerns about the study's rigor.

This prediction is low due to the extremely small sample size (N=18), which produces unstable estimates and increases the likelihood of a false positive. Furthermore, there is a major discrepancy between the reported F‑statistic and the reported effect size (ηp² of .7 is not arithmetically possible with the given F‑value), suggesting a significant reporting error. While the p‑value is nominally low, such findings in small samples often reflect an overestimation of the true effect size and are characteristically difficult to replicate.

0.38
The reported p-value is low (corresponding to F(1, 17) = 9.33) and the effect size is extremely large, which would normally suggest a robust finding. However, the very small sample size (N=18) makes these estimates highly unstable and likely inflated due to publication bias. While the effect is theoretically plausible, findings from such low-powered studies often fail to replicate, as the original result has a higher chance of being a false positive or a gross overestimation.

0.48
The primary concern for replication is the very small sample size (N=18), which produces unstable estimates and low statistical power. While the reported p-value is strong (corresponding to p≈.007), the associated effect size (ηp² = .7) is implausibly large for this type of cognitive phenomenon and is likely a significant overestimation. Studies with small samples and very large effects are often driven by sampling error and have a lower probability of successful replication.

Despite a low p-value (p≈.007), the very small sample size (N=18) is a major weakness, making the results less stable and trustworthy. This small sample likely contributed to the ""winner's curse,"" resulting in an extremely large and probably inflated effect size estimate (η²=.7). While the within-subjects design is powerful, the combination of a tiny sample and a suspiciously large effect from a subfield with mixed replication history suggests a low probability of successful replication."
