Some subfields—such as social or developmental psychology—have historically shown lower replication rates compared to others like clinical or personality psychology, though individual study quality still matters.",0.45,0.62,0.35,0.38,0.62,0.484,"0.45
This study has conflicting indicators for replicability. While the reported effect size is very large and the senior author is well-established, the sample size is small (N=24), and the degrees of freedom (df=13) suggest an even smaller effective N for the key test. This, combined with a p-value (0.02) close to the significance threshold, raises concerns that the original result may be a false positive or that the effect size is substantially overestimated.
---
0.62
Although the reported effect size is very large (ηp² = .354) and the first author is highly cited, suggesting a robust phenomenon, the statistical evidence is weakened by the very small sample size implied by the test statistic's degrees of freedom (df=13). Furthermore, the p-value of 0.02 is not extremely low and falls into a range that has been associated with lower replication rates. These statistical weaknesses temper the otherwise positive signals from the effect size and subfield.
---
0.35
The probability of successful replication is low due to several statistical weaknesses. The p-value of 0.02 is only narrowly significant, and the F-test's degrees of freedom (df=13) are inconsistent with the reported sample size (N=24), implying a much smaller effective sample was used in the analysis. This small effective N suggests the very large reported effect size is likely an overestimation (winner's curse), making the finding statistically fragile and less likely to replicate.
---
0.38
The probability of replication is low due to the small sample size and a p-value (0.02) that is close to the threshold for statistical significance. A major concern is the discrepancy between the reported N=24 and the analysis's degrees of freedom (13), which suggests a fragile statistical test based on a very small effective sample. While the high author citation count and large effect size are positive indicators, they are insufficient to overcome the weak primary statistical evidence.
---
0.62
The prediction is moderately positive due to a very large reported effect size (__p^2 = 0.354) and a controlled, within-subjects cognitive paradigm from a highly cited author, which are factors that favor replicability. However, confidence is tempered by the very small sample size, implied by the low degrees of freedom (df=13), and a p-value (p=0.02) that is close to the significance threshold, making the finding potentially fragile. A successful replication may depend on whether the large effect was an overestimation due to the small sample."

The very small p‑value (<0.005) and extremely large effect size (ηp² = .374) are strong positive predictors of replicability. While the small sample size (N=24) increases the risk that this effect is overestimated, the use of a powerful within‑subjects design and the strong statistical evidence suggest a successful replication is quite likely. The programmatic nature of the six experiments also indicates a robust, theory-driven investigation rather than a one-off finding.

The prediction is high due to the very large reported effect size (ηp² = .374) and strong p-value, which suggest a robust phenomenon. While the sample size (N=24) is small, the effect is large enough that the study was likely well-powered, and the programmatic series of six experiments demonstrates a systematic investigation that reduces the chance of a spurious result. The standard analysis and controlled experimental design further increase the likelihood of replication.

The study reports a very large effect size (ηp² = .374) and a highly significant p-value (< .005), which are strong positive indicators for replicability. Furthermore, the paper describes a programmatic series of experiments that successfully manipulate the effect, suggesting a robust finding based on a well-understood mechanism. Although the sample size is small, the use of a powerful within-subjects design makes it more likely that this strong reported effect is reliable.

The study reports a strong signal, with a low p-value (<.005) and a very large effect size (ηp² = .374), which are both positive indicators for replication. However, this evidence is derived from a very small sample (N=24), which increases the risk that the effect size is substantially overestimated and the finding is not robust. The prediction balances the strong reported evidence against the methodological weakness of the small sample.
---
0.75
The prediction is moderately high due to the very strong statistical evidence, including a low p‑value (<0.005) and a large effect size (ηp² = .374). However, the small sample size (N=24) is a significant concern and may indicate that the reported effect size is an overestimate. Nevertheless, the robust, within-subjects experimental design and systematic manipulation across multiple experiments suggest the core finding is reliable."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
Although many accounts of task switching emphasize the importance of working memory as a substantial source of the switch cost, there is a lack of evidence demonstrating that task switching actually places additional demands on working memory. The present study addressed this issue by implementing task switching in continuous complex span tasks with strictly controlled time parameters. A series of 4 experiments demonstrate that recall performance decreased as a function of the number of task switches and that the concurrent load of item maintenance had no influence on task switching. These results indicate that task switching induces a cost on working memory functioning. Implications for theories of task switching, working memory, and resource sharing are addressed.

The reported effect size is large, and a finding demonstrated across four internal experiments is a strong signal of a robust effect. While the sample size is small and the p-value is close to the significance threshold, these concerns are substantially mitigated by the successful internal replication. The standard cognitive paradigm also increases the likelihood that a new lab could successfully reproduce the procedure and, therefore, the result.
---
0.75
This study has a high probability of replication due to the large reported effect size (ηp² = 0.181) and its demonstration across a series of four experiments, which signals robustness. Although the sample size is small and the p-value is not far from the .05 threshold, the strength of the effect and the controlled nature of a cognitive psychology experiment suggest the finding is likely real. The internal replication across multiple experiments in the original paper is a particularly strong positive indicator.
---
0.35
The prediction is low due to the very small sample size (N=25) and a p-value that is only marginally significant (the F-statistic corresponds to p≈0.03). These factors suggest the study was underpowered and that the large reported effect size is likely an overestimation. While the finding comes from the more controlled cognitive subfield, the weak statistical evidence for this specific test makes a successful replication improbable.
---
0.35
The prediction is low because the study combines a small sample size (N=25) with a p-value (p≈0.03) that is only slightly below the standard significance threshold. This combination suggests low statistical power and increases the chance that the large reported effect size is an overestimation. While the finding is from a controlled cognitive paradigm, these statistical weaknesses present a significant challenge for a successful direct replication.
---
0.65
This prediction balances strong but conflicting signals. The primary risk factors are the small sample size and a p-value close to the 0.05 significance threshold (the F-statistic yields p≈0.03), which are associated with lower replication rates. However, this risk is substantially mitigated because the finding is supported by a series of four experiments, which provides powerful evidence of internal replication and suggests the effect is robust."

A mechanism for the intermixed-blocked effect is proposed, which combines theories from associative learning and memory.

This study has a good chance of replication due to its strong p-value (p < .01, calculated from the F-statistic) and a medium effect size reported for a phenomenon described as ""robust."" Although the small sample size (N=32) is a major risk factor for instability, the study's focus on a well-established effect within cognitive psychology makes a successful replication quite likely.
---
0.85
The study reports strong statistical evidence; the F-statistic corresponds to a p-value of approximately .007, which is highly significant. This result is supported by a medium effect size (dz = 0.51) obtained from a within-subjects design, which is generally more powerful and less noisy than a between-subjects design. Given these factors, a direct replication is well-powered and has a high probability of finding the effect again.
---
0.82
The reported statistical test is strong (F(1,31)=8.38 corresponds to p<.01) for a moderate effect size (dz=0.51), and the paper includes two internal replications of the finding. While the sample size of 32 is a notable limitation that could lead to an overestimated effect, the established nature of the phenomenon and the strong evidence presented combine to suggest a high probability of replication success.

0.88
This study has a high probability of replication due to a strong combination of factors. The reported F-statistic corresponds to a highly significant p-value (p < .01), and the medium effect size (dz = 0.51) was detected with good statistical power given the within-subjects design. The fact that the paper investigates a phenomenon described as ""robust"" using a straightforward experimental manipulation in cognitive psychology further increases confidence in its reliability.
---
0.78
The prediction is moderately high due to a strong p-value (p≈.007, calculated from the F-statistic) and a statistically powerful within-subjects design appropriate for this cognitive psychology topic. While the sample size of 32 is a limitation and can lead to less stable effect size estimates, the reported medium effect size (dz=0.51) is plausible and the other metrics are solid, suggesting a good chance of successful replication."

The prediction is cautiously optimistic due to competing factors. The very low p‑value (0.002) and large effect size (dz = 0.724) from a simple analysis are strong positive indicators for replication. However, the small sample size (N=24) introduces substantial uncertainty and raises the possibility that the original effect size is an overestimate, which would make the effect more difficult to detect in a replication attempt.

0.75
The reported p-value is very low (0.002) and the effect size is large (dz=0.724), which are strong positive predictors of replicability. The primary concern is the small sample size (N=24), which can lead to overestimated effects and lower stability. However, the strength of the initial evidence, combined with a simple analysis and a powerful within-subjects design, suggests a favorable outcome for a replication attempt.

The prediction is high due to the strong p-value (0.002) and large effect size (dz = 0.724), which are the best predictors of replicability. While the sample size is small (N=24), this is somewhat offset by the simple, low-flexibility analysis (dependent t-test) and the fact that basic cognitive effects are often robust. The small sample introduces uncertainty, but the signal is strong enough to suggest a high likelihood of successful replication.

This study has a high likelihood of replication due to its very strong statistical evidence, including a low p‑value (0.002) and a large effect size (dz = 0.72). Although the small sample size (N=24) is a significant concern as it can lead to inflated effect estimates, this risk is somewhat offset by the simple analysis and the fact that the study investigates a core, often robust, phenomenon in cognitive psychology.

0.68
The study reports a strong p-value (0.002) and a large effect size (dz = 0.72), both of which are positive predictors of replicability. However, the small sample size (N=24) is a significant concern, as it creates a wide confidence interval around the effect size, meaning the result is less stable and may be an overestimation. While the simple analysis and cognitive subfield are favorable, the low statistical power of the original study is the primary source of uncertainty."

This study has a very high probability of replication due to its extremely large effect size (d = 1.02) and correspondingly strong statistical evidence (t(99) = 10.18, p << .001). The sample size of 100 is more than adequate for a simple dependent t-test, providing high statistical power to detect such a robust effect. These factors, combined with the study's focus on well-established phenomena in cognitive psychology, suggest the finding is highly unlikely to be a statistical artifact and should be readily observable in a new sample.

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
When expectations and stereotypes are activated at retrieval, they spontaneously create distorted and illusory recollections that are consistent with these expectations. Participants studied doctor (physician)-related and lawyer-related statements that were presented by 2 different people. When informed, on a subsequent source memory test, (i.e., of who presented what) that one of the study sources was actually a doctor and the other source was a lawyer, there was a strong tendency to attribute the test items in a stereotype-consistent manner. In 3 experiments, participants frequently reported recollecting specific details, such as via ""remember"" judgments, to justify their stereotype-consistent but incorrect responses. These experiments rule out explanations involving either the misattribution of strong familiarity or differences in the bias to making remember responses as accounts for the illusory source attributions. Instead, the illusory recollections are consistent with the notion that recollective experience is manufactured from both the information in the memory trace and information in the retrieval environment, such as an individual's expectations, stereotypes, and general knowledge.

The prediction is high due to the combination of a very strong p-value (p<.001) and a large effect size (ηp² = .32), which indicate a robust finding. While the sample size is relatively small, the magnitude of the effect makes it highly detectable and therefore likely to replicate successfully. The fact that the original paper reports three successful experiments further suggests the stability of this well-established cognitive phenomenon.

0.85
The extremely low p‑value (p < .001) and very large effect size (ηp² = .32) signal a strong and highly detectable effect. While the sample size of 39 is modest, the large effect suggests the study was well-powered. The fact that the original authors reported three successful experiments further increases confidence in the finding's robustness.

0.92
The prediction is high due to the combination of a very strong p-value (<.001) and a large effect size (ηp² = .32), which indicate a robust finding. While the sample size is modest, the statistical power is exceptionally high for an effect of this magnitude, and the use of a simple ANOVA with low analytical flexibility further boosts confidence in replicability.
---
0.92
The reported p-value is very low (p < .001) and the effect size is exceptionally large (ηp² = .32), both of which are strong positive predictors of replicability. While the sample size is modest, the sheer strength of the reported effect makes a successful replication highly probable. The finding, a stereotype-driven memory error, is a robust phenomenon in cognitive psychology, and the use of a standard ANOVA reduces concerns about analytical complexity.

0.90
This study has a very high probability of replication due to the extremely strong statistical evidence. The reported p-value is very low (p<.001) and the effect size is exceptionally large (ηp² = .32), suggesting a robust and easily detectable phenomenon. While the sample size is modest, it appears more than adequate to detect an effect of this magnitude, which greatly outweighs the potential concerns associated with the social psychology subfield."

The extremely low p-value (p<.001) and exceptionally large effect size (partial ηp^2 = 0.488) are strong indicators of a robust finding.

The prediction is high due to the exceptionally strong evidence presented. The very small p-value (<.001) and extremely large effect size (ηp² = 0.488) suggest a robust phenomenon that is unlikely to be a statistical artifact. While the sample size is small, the study's use of a powerful mixed-design and its grounding in the well-established cognitive literature on numerical processing make a successful replication highly probable.

This study has a very high probability of replication primarily due to the extremely large reported effect size (partial η² = 0.488) and the correspondingly low p-value (p < .001). While the sample size is modest, the massive effect suggests the finding is robust and easily detectable, likely overcoming any potential issues from the sample size or the moderate complexity of the mixed ANOVA. The nature of the study, a controlled cognitive experiment on a well-known type of interference effect, further supports a high likelihood of success.

The prediction is high due to the exceptionally large effect size (ηp² = 0.488) and highly significant p‑value (p < .001), which suggest a very strong signal. Although the sample size of 32 is small, a risk factor for replication, the sheer magnitude of the reported effect makes it very likely to be detected again. Furthermore, the finding is based on a standard, lab‑based cognitive paradigm which tends to produce more robust results.

The reported effect size (ηp² = 0.488) is exceptionally large, and the p-value is correspondingly low (p < .001), both of which are strong indicators of a replicable finding. While the sample size is relatively small, the sheer magnitude of the effect suggests it is robust and should be readily detectable. Furthermore, the study uses a standard, controlled experimental paradigm from cognitive psychology, a subfield with a comparatively higher rate of successful replications."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
The authors investigated semantic neighborhood density effects on visual word processing to examine the dynamics of activation and competition among semantic representations. Experiment 1 validated feature-based semantic representations as a basis for computing semantic neighborhood density and suggested that near and distant neighbors have opposite effects on word processing. Experiment 2 confirmed these results: Word processing was slower for dense near neighborhoods and faster for dense distant neighborhoods. Analysis of a computational model showed that attractor dynamics can produce this pattern of neighborhood effects. The authors argue for reconsideration of traditional models of neighborhood effects in terms of attractor dynamics, which allow both inhibitory and facilitative effects to emerge.

This study has a very high likelihood of replication despite the small sample size. The extremely low p-value (p<.001) and massive effect size (ηp² = .452) indicate a very strong signal that is unlikely to be a false positive, providing a large buffer for a replication attempt to succeed. While the small sample (N=22) is a major concern and suggests the true effect may be smaller, the use of a powerful within-subjects design in a controlled cognitive experiment makes the reported result quite credible.

While the very small sample size (N=22) is a major concern and suggests the reported effect size may be inflated, the extremely strong statistical evidence (p < .001, ηp² = .452) points to a robust underlying phenomenon. The use of a within-subjects design (RM ANOVA) increases statistical power, making it more likely that a true effect exists. A replication would likely succeed, though the observed effect size would probably be smaller.

0.75
The very small sample size (N=22) is a significant concern and suggests the massive reported effect size (ηp² = .452) is likely inflated. However, this is strongly counterbalanced by the very low p-value (p<.001) and the presence of an internal replication within the paper (Experiment 2 confirming Experiment 1). These factors suggest a genuine, though probably smaller, effect exists, making a successful replication likely.

0.72
This study reports a very low p-value (<.001) and a very large effect size (ηp² = .452), both of which strongly suggest a replicable finding. However, the sample size is very small (N=22), which increases the risk that the reported effect size is an overestimate and that the finding is less stable than the statistics imply. The use of a within-subjects design in cognitive psychology, where effects are often robust, helps mitigate the small sample concern, leading to a prediction of moderately high success.

The extremely low p-value (<.001) and very large effect size (ηp² = .452) strongly suggest a replicable finding. Although the sample size (N=22) is very small, this major concern is partly mitigated by the study's powerful within-subjects design and the confirmation of results in a second experiment. These factors combined indicate a high likelihood that the core effect, even if smaller than originally reported, would be successfully replicated."

This prediction is low primarily due to the combination of a small sample size (N=48) and a p-value that is extremely close to the .05 threshold, which suggests the result is statistically fragile. Such ""just-significant"" findings from underpowered studies are less likely to replicate successfully, and the reported medium effect size is likely an overestimation. The complexity of the mixed ANOVA design, testing for an interaction, further reduces the probability of a successful replication.
---
0.35
The primary reason for the low prediction is the p-value being just under the .05 significance threshold, a strong negative predictor of replicability. This concern is heightened by a modest sample size (N=48) for a potentially complex mixed ANOVA interaction, which suggests the study may be underpowered. Although the reported medium effect size is encouraging, it is likely inflated due to the marginal p-value and small sample.
---
0.25
The reported F-statistic is very close to the critical value for p < .05, suggesting the result is marginally significant and may not be robust. This, combined with a small sample size for a mixed ANOVA design, increases the likelihood that the medium effect size is an overestimation and that the finding may be a false positive. While the study is a controlled lab experiment, the low statistical power and borderline p-value are strong negative predictors for successful replication.
---
0.35
The primary reason for this low predicted success rate is the p-value being just under the .05 threshold; an F-statistic of 3.13 with these degrees of freedom yields a p-value of approximately .048. Such marginal results, especially when paired with a relatively small sample size, have a low probability of successful replication. While the reported effect size is medium and the experimental paradigm is standard, the weak statistical evidence for the key interaction effect suggests the original finding may not be robust.

The primary reason for this low prediction is the p-value being just under the .05 threshold, which corresponds to the reported F-statistic. Such ""p-just-so"" results have a lower probability of replicating successfully, especially when paired with a relatively small sample size (N=48) for a mixed ANOVA design. While the reported effect size is medium, it is likely an overestimation due to the low statistical power and borderline significance."

The prediction is high due to the extremely strong statistical evidence, including a very low p-value (< .001) and a massive effect size (__p^2 = 0.550). While the sample size of 36 is small, which can sometimes lead to inflated effect size estimates, the reported effect is so large that the underlying phenomenon is almost certain to be detected in a replication. The finding from a controlled cognitive experiment on a fundamental process like memory further supports a high likelihood of success.
---
0.88
Although the sample size of 36 is small, which typically lowers replication likelihood, the statistical evidence for the reported interaction is exceptionally strong. The very low p-value (<.001) is supported by a massive effect size (partial η² = 0.55), suggesting a robust phenomenon that should be readily detectable even with a modest sample. Studies in cognitive psychology on fundamental learning processes also tend to replicate well.
---
0.85
This study reports an exceptionally low p-value (<.001) and a massive effect size (ηp² = 0.55), both of which strongly predict replicability. Although the sample size is small (N=36) and the mixed ANOVA analysis is complex, factors that can decrease replication success, the sheer magnitude of the statistical evidence suggests a very robust phenomenon. The strength of this signal likely overcomes the potential instability from the small sample, making a successful replication highly probable.
---
0.85
This prediction is high due to the exceptionally strong statistical evidence, including a very low p‑value (<.001) and a massive reported effect size (partial eta squared = .550). While the small sample size is a notable weakness and can inflate effect estimates, a true effect of this magnitude would be highly robust and likely to replicate successfully. The finding is a complex interaction from an experienced author in cognitive psychology, a field with generally higher replication rates for this type of tightly controlled experiment.
---
0.75
Despite the very small sample size (N=36), which raises concerns about effect size inflation, the reported statistics are exceptionally strong (p < .001, pη² = 0.55).

Note:
Some subfields—such as social or developmental psychology—have historically shown lower replication rates compared to others like clinical or personality psychology, though individual study quality still matters.",0.45,0.35,0.45,0.42,0.35,0.404,"0.45
The primary reason for this prediction is the combination of a p-value (0.028) that is very close to the 0.05 significance threshold and a small effect size (d = 0.198). Findings that are ""just significant"" have a lower probability of replicating, and small effects require large, high-powered samples to be detected reliably. Although the sample size of 95 is adequate for a within-subjects design, the statistical weakness of the original evidence makes a successful replication less certain.
---
0.35
The primary drivers for this low replication estimate are the reported p‑value of 0.028 and the small effect size (d = 0.198). A p‑value this close to the traditional 0.05 threshold signals a finding that may not be robust to sampling variation, and small effects are inherently more difficult to detect reliably. While the sample size is reasonable and the analysis is simple, these key statistical indicators suggest a high probability that a replication attempt would fail to achieve significance.
---
0.45
The prediction is low despite the study being in a typically replicable subfield (cognitive psychology) with a simple analysis. The primary concerns are the statistically weak results: the p-value of .028 is very close to the conventional .05 threshold, and the reported effect size (d=0.198) is small. Such borderline results are often susceptible to sampling error and have a lower probability of achieving significance in a direct replication.
---
0.42
The prediction is below 50% primarily due to the combination of a p-value (0.028) that is only slightly below the 0.05 significance threshold and a small effect size (d=0.198). While the sample size (N=95) is adequate and the analysis is simple, findings with such weak evidence are highly susceptible to sampling variation and the winner's curse, making a successful replication less likely. The study's strengths in its design are not enough to overcome the fragility of the statistical evidence.
---
0.35
The reported p-value of 0.028 is very close to the 0.05 threshold for statistical significance, and the effect size is small (d = 0.198). Findings with such borderline statistical evidence have a substantially lower probability of replicating successfully. While the sample size is moderate and the analysis is simple, these factors are not enough to overcome the weakness of the original evidence."

The very low p-value (<.001) and large effect size (ηp² = 0.186) are strong positive indicators for replication. Although the sample size of 39 is small, which increases the risk of an overestimated effect, the use of a within-subjects (RM ANOVA) design and a controlled computerized task enhances statistical power and procedural fidelity. These strengths suggest a reasonably high probability of a successful replication, despite the sample size concern.

This study has a high probability of replication due to its very strong evidence, including a low p-value (< .001) and a large effect size (ηp² = 0.186). Although the sample size (N=39) is small, which can increase the risk of an overestimated effect, the sheer magnitude of the reported finding suggests a robust phenomenon. The use of a controlled, within-subjects design (RM ANOVA) in cognitive psychology further strengthens the prediction, as such designs often have higher precision.

This study has a good chance of replicating due to its very strong p‑value (<.001) and large effect size (__p^2 = 0.186). The primary risk factor is the small sample size of 39, which can lead to overestimated effects and lower stability. Despite this concern, the strength of the statistical evidence is substantial enough to make a successful replication likely, especially given the experienced author and straightforward experimental design.

0.80
The prediction is high due to the very low p‑value (<.001) and large reported effect size, which are strong predictors of a successful replication. While the small sample size (N=39) is a significant concern that increases the risk of effect size inflation, this is partly offset by the powerful within‑subjects (RM ANOVA) design typical of cognitive research. The experienced author further increases confidence in the finding.

The prediction is high due to very strong statistical evidence: a highly significant p-value (<.001) and a large reported effect size (ηp² = 0.186). These factors are among the best predictors of replication success and suggest a robust underlying phenomenon. Although the sample size (N=39) is small, this is partially offset by the statistical power of the repeated-measures ANOVA design, and the experienced author and straightforward analysis further increase confidence in the result."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
Three experiments with short-term recognition tasks are reported. In Experiments 1 and 2, participants decided whether a probe matched a list item specified by its spatial location. Items presented at study in a different location (intrusion probes) had to be rejected. Serial position curves of positive, new, and intrusion probes over the probed location's position were mostly parallel. Serial position curves of intrusion probes over their position of origin were again parallel to those of positive probes. Experiment 3 showed largely parallel serial position effects for positive probes and for intrusion probes plotted over positions in a relevant and an irrelevant list, respectively. The results support a dual-process theory in which recognition is based on familiarity and recollection, and recollection uses 2 retrieval routes, from context to item and from item to context.

This study has a very high probability of successful replication due to the combination of a highly significant p-value (<.001) and a very large effect size (ηp² = .31). Although the sample size is modest, the within-subjects design (RM ANOVA) has high statistical power, making the small sample less of a concern for an effect of this magnitude. The finding's credibility is further bolstered by the first author's high citation count, suggesting extensive experience in the field.

0.88
This study has a very high likelihood of replication due to the extremely strong statistical evidence reported, including a very low p-value (p < .001) and a large effect size (ηp² = .31). Although the sample size of 32 is small, the use of a powerful repeated-measures design for a core cognitive phenomenon makes the finding highly credible. The first author's high citation count also suggests a well-established lab with reliable methods.

0.92
The prediction is high due to exceptionally strong evidence, including a very low p‑value (<.001) and a large effect size (ηp² = .31). These metrics, combined with a finding replicated across three internal experiments, suggest a robust phenomenon that is highly likely to be found again. The moderate sample size is sufficient for a powerful within-subjects design detecting an effect of this magnitude.
---
0.88
The prediction for high replicability is driven by the combination of a very strong p-value (p<.001) and a large reported effect size (ηp²=.31). While the sample size is small (N=32), this weakness is offset by the fact that the paper reports three separate experiments showing a consistent pattern, suggesting the finding is robust. The study’s focus on a core cognitive process, which tends to be more reliable than social phenomena, further increases the likelihood of a successful replication.

The prediction is moderately positive due to the decent sample size and the study's nature as a controlled cognitive experiment, a subfield with higher-than-average replication rates. However, the key statistical evidence is somewhat weak; the F-statistic yields a p-value (p≈.028) that is close to the .05 threshold, and the effect size is small-to-medium. These factors suggest a direct replication would have only moderate statistical power, making a successful replication likely but far from certain.

0.45
The primary negative indicator is the p-value, which at <.05 is only marginally significant and a known risk factor for replication failure. This is combined with a small-to-medium effect size (η²=.05), suggesting the finding may not be robust. While the sample size is reasonable for a mixed ANOVA and the study presents a series of three experiments, the weak statistical evidence for the key effect makes a successful replication less likely.
---
0.62
The study has a reasonably good sample size for its design, and its p-value (which calculates to p≈.028) is significant, which are positive indicators. However, the effect size is small-to-medium (η²=.05), and smaller effects are known to be less likely to replicate successfully. The finding is also a specific interaction from a more complex mixed ANOVA, which can be more fragile and sensitive to procedural variations than a simple main effect.
---
0.45
While the study has a decent sample size and an experienced first author, the statistical evidence for the key finding is weak. The reported p-value is close to the conventional .05 threshold and the effect size is small (η_p^2 = .05), both of which are associated with lower replication rates. Such findings are more likely to be overestimated or the result of sampling error, making a successful replication challenging.
---
0.35
The prediction is low primarily due to the combination of a small effect size (ηp² = .05) and a p‑value (p < .05) that is relatively close to the conventional significance threshold. This suggests the original study was underpowered, increasing the risk that the finding is a false positive or an overestimated effect. Furthermore, the key result is a specific interaction effect, which is often more fragile and difficult to replicate than a main effect."

However, bilinguals showed no facilitation from spatial cues, showed a strong inhibition of return effect, and exhibited a more pronounced attentional blink. These results suggest that bilinguals do not differ from monolinguals in terms of active inhibition but have acquired a better ability to maintain action goals and to use them to bias goal-related information. Under some circumstances, this ability may indirectly lead to more pronounced reactive inhibition of irrelevant information.

The primary reason for this low prediction is the extremely small sample size (N=18), which makes the findings highly unstable and prone to large error, even with a low reported p-value. Such a small sample in a between-groups design means the study was severely underpowered, and the significant result is likely either a false positive or a substantial overestimation of the true effect size. Furthermore, the ""bilingual advantage"" is a notoriously contentious and difficult-to-replicate area within cognitive psychology.

The likelihood of successful replication is very low. The primary reason is the extremely small sample size (N=18), which undermines confidence in the findings and suggests any effects are likely inflated, despite the low p-value. Furthermore, the reported degrees of freedom (df=93) are mathematically inconsistent with the sample size, indicating a potential reporting error, and the research area of bilingual cognitive advantages is known for its mixed and often difficult-to-replicate findings.
---
0.15
The prediction is very low primarily due to the extremely small sample size (N=18), which yields unstable results and low statistical power. Although the reported p‑value is strong, such a result from a tiny sample is likely an overestimation, a problem exacerbated by the known mixed findings in this research area and a major inconsistency in the reported statistics (the F‑test's degrees of freedom are impossible for a sample of 18).
---
0.20
The prediction for replication success is low primarily due to the extremely small sample size (N=18), which provides low statistical power and risks generating an inflated effect size estimate. While the reported p-value is strong, findings from underpowered studies are often not robust and can be susceptible to false positives. The inconsistency between the reported sample size and the F-statistic's degrees of freedom further undermines confidence in the result's stability.
---
0.25
The primary reason for the low replication probability is the extremely small sample size (N=18), which makes the study severely underpowered and the significant p-value highly suspect. Such small samples often produce inflated effect size estimates that are unlikely to be reproduced, particularly in a research area the abstract itself describes as ""equivocal."" Furthermore, the reported degrees of freedom for the F-test appear inconsistent with the sample size, raising concerns about the statistical analysis or reporting."

The prediction is high due to multiple strong statistical indicators. The study reports a very low p-value (<.001) and a large corresponding F-statistic from a reasonably large sample (N=154), which are strong predictors of replicability. The calculated effect size is large, and the within-subjects design is powerful, suggesting the finding is a robust phenomenon rather than a chance result.

The probability of replication is very high, primarily driven by the extremely strong statistical evidence: a p-value less than .001 and a large F-statistic (F(1, 152) = 23.176). This suggests a large and reliable effect, which is further bolstered by a solid sample size (N=154) for a powerful within-subjects design. While priming effects can be fragile, the strength of this specific, theory-driven finding indicates it is robust.
---
0.85
This prediction is high due to the very strong statistical evidence, including a low p-value (<.001) and a large F-statistic, which implies a large effect size. The sample size of 154 is also quite solid for a within-subjects (RM ANOVA) experimental design. While priming effects can be sensitive, these robust metrics for a core cognitive process suggest the finding is likely to replicate.

0.87
The prediction for high replicability is driven by the very low p-value (<.001) and large F-statistic, which are strong predictors of a robust effect. This confidence is further supported by the substantial sample size for a within-subjects design and a large estimated effect size (partial η² ≈ 0.13). The study's use of a controlled, lab-based cognitive paradigm also favors successful replication.

The very low p-value (<.001) and extremely large effect size (d=1.51) are strong predictors of a successful replication. While the sample size is small, this is less concerning for a within-subjects cognitive psychology experiment where such large effects can be robust.

The extremely strong statistical evidence, including a very small p-value (<.001) and a very large effect size (d=1.51), suggests a high likelihood of replication. While the sample size is small, the study investigates a core cognitive phenomenon (the Hebb effect) known for its robustness, and the sheer magnitude of the reported effect makes it likely to be detected even in a new sample. A successful replication is highly probable, though the effect size may be slightly smaller upon re-examination.

The reported p-value is very low (p<.001) and the effect size is very large (d=1.51), both of which strongly suggest a replicable finding. While the small sample size (N=24) is a significant concern as it can produce unstable and inflated effect estimates, the sheer strength of the reported statistics partially mitigates this risk. Furthermore, the study investigates a variation of the Hebb repetition effect, a well-established and robust phenomenon in cognitive psychology, which increases confidence that the underlying effect is real.

The reported p-value is very low (<.001) and the effect size is extremely large (d=1.51), both of which are strong positive predictors of replication success. While the sample size is small (N=24), the study investigates a well-established paradigm in cognitive psychology (Hebb effect), and the powerful statistics suggest the finding is robust enough to overcome the sample-size limitation. Therefore, a successful replication is highly likely.

0.75
The prediction is moderately high due to the very strong reported evidence, including a p-value <.001 and a massive effect size (d=1.51). The study also builds on a well-established cognitive phenomenon (the Hebb effect) using a powerful within-subjects design, which generally improves reliability. The primary concern is the very small sample size (N=24), which increases the risk that the reported effect size is inflated and may not be fully reproduced upon replication."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
Recent evidence suggests that the processes responsible for generating a phonological code from print are flexible in skilled readers. An important goal, therefore, is to identify the conditions that lead to changes in how a phonological code is computed. Five experiments are reported that examine whether phonological processes change as predicted by the pathway control hypothesis when reading aloud words and nonwords. Changes in reading processes were assessed by measuring the effect of predictable switches between stimulus categories across trials. The results of the present experiments are argued to be consistent with the pathway control hypothesis.

The probability of a successful replication is extremely low primarily because the original study reported a non-significant result (p > 0.1) with a very small effect size (η² = .026). Furthermore, the tiny sample size (N=16) means the study was severely underpowered, making its estimates highly unstable. A replication is therefore very unlikely to find a statistically significant effect.

This study reported a non-significant result (p > 0.1) with a very small effect size (η² = .026). A successful replication would mean finding a similarly non-significant result, which is highly probable given the initial weak evidence for an effect. The very small sample size (N=16) means the original study was severely underpowered, making its failure to find an effect the most likely and replicable outcome.

The reported finding is a non-significant result (p > 0.1) with a very small effect size (η² = .026). A successful replication would also find a non-significant result, which is highly probable given the weakness of the original effect. Although the extremely small sample size (N=16) means the study was underpowered and its estimates are noisy, the most likely outcome of a replication attempt is another failure to find a significant effect.

The likelihood of a successful replication is extremely low primarily because the original study reported a non-significant result (p > 0.1), meaning it failed to find the effect in the first place. This conclusion is strengthened by the study's very small sample size (N=16) and small effect size (η² = .026), which suggest the experiment was underpowered and the results are unstable. A replication attempt is therefore highly unlikely to achieve statistical significance.
---
0.08
The original study reported a non-significant result (p > 0.1), so a replication is highly unlikely to achieve success, which is typically defined as finding a significant effect (p < .05). This is compounded by an extremely small sample size (N=16) and a small effect size (η² = .026), indicating the study was severely underpowered and the original non-significant finding is likely to be reproduced. The authors' soft language (""argued to be consistent"") further signals weak evidence."

The prediction is driven by the combination of a small sample size (N=32) and a p-value (p=.03) that is close to the conventional significance threshold, both of which are associated with lower replicability. Although the reported effect size is large (ηp²=.143) and the study is in a subfield with typically higher replication rates (cognitive), the small sample suggests the effect size may be overestimated and the finding is not robust.
---
0.35
The predicted probability is low primarily due to the p-value (0.03), which is very close to the conventional significance threshold and is a strong negative predictor of replicability. This concern is amplified by the small sample size (N=32), which suggests the large reported effect size (ηp² = .143) is likely an overestimation. The complex nature of the reported interaction, which produces ""apparent additivity,"" can also be more difficult to reproduce than a simple main effect.
---
0.25
The prediction for a low probability of successful replication is driven primarily by the small sample size (N=32) and the p-value (0.03) being just under the conventional significance threshold. This combination suggests the original study was underpowered, increasing the chances that the significant result was a false positive or that the large reported effect size is inflated. While the within-subjects design is a strength, the complex interaction described in the abstract may be difficult to reproduce with precision.
---
0.35
The primary drivers of this low prediction are the small sample size (N=32) and a p-value (p=0.03) that is very close to the conventional significance threshold of .05. While the reported effect size is large, such estimates are often inflated in small, just‑significant studies, meaning the true effect may be substantially smaller. The complexity of the finding, which relies on nuanced patterns in response‑time distributions, may also make a precise replication more difficult.
---
0.35
The probability of replication is low due to the combination of a small sample size (N=32) and a p-value (p=0.03) that is only slightly below the standard significance threshold. While the reported effect size is large, with such a small sample it is likely an overestimation, and the original finding has a high chance of being a false positive. Although the study is in cognitive psychology, which tends to replicate well, these specific statistical indicators suggest the result is not robust."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
In 2 experiments participants named pictures of common objects with superimposed distractor words. In one naming condition, the pictures and words were presented simultaneously on every trial, and participants produced the target response immediately. In the other naming condition, the presentation of the picture preceded the presentation of the distractor by 1,000 ms, and participants delayed production of their naming response until distractor word presentation. Within each naming condition, the distractor words were either semantic category coordinates of the target pictures or unrelated. Orthogonal to this manipulation of semantic relatedness, the frequency of the pictures' names was manipulated. The authors observed semantic interference effects in both the immediate and delayed naming conditions but a frequency effect only in the immediate naming condition. These data indicate that semantic interference can be observed when target picture naming latencies do not reflect the bottleneck at the level of lexical selection. In the context of other findings from the picture-word interference paradigm, the authors interpret these data as supporting the view that the semantic interference effect arises at a postlexical level of processing.

The primary reason for the low replication probability is the reported p-value of <.06, which fails to meet the conventional standard for statistical significance (p < .05). While the reported effect size is large, this estimate is unreliable and likely inflated due to the small sample size (N=32), which provides low statistical power. A finding that was not statistically significant in the original study is unlikely to be significant in a direct replication.

0.35
The primary reason for this low prediction is the reported p-value of <.06, which fails to meet the conventional threshold for statistical significance (p<.05) and indicates weak evidence for the effect. Although the sample size (N=32) is adequate for a within-subjects design and the reported effect size is large, the weak p-value suggests the finding is not robust. A direct replication of a ""marginally significant"" result has a low probability of achieving a conventionally significant outcome.
---
0.15
The probability of successful replication is very low primarily because the original study's key finding was not statistically significant at the conventional alpha=.05 level (p < .06). Such ""marginally significant"" results rarely replicate. Furthermore, the small sample size (N=32) suggests the study was underpowered, meaning the large reported effect size is likely an unstable and inflated estimate.
---
0.32
The primary reason for this low estimate is the original study’s p-value of <.06, which is not statistically significant by conventional standards (α = .05) and is a strong indicator of replication failure. This weak evidence is compounded by a small sample size (N=32) and a notable inconsistency between the reported F‑statistic and the much larger reported effect size (d=0.74), suggesting the result is likely imprecise and unstable. These statistical weaknesses suggest a low probability of a successful replication, despite the author's moderate citation count.

The primary factor driving this low prediction is the reported p-value of <.06, which fails to meet the conventional threshold for statistical significance (p < .05). While the reported effect size is large, such estimates are often inflated in studies with small sample sizes (N=32). Therefore, a direct replication is unlikely to produce a statistically significant result."

The prediction is low due to the combination of an extremely small sample size (N=8) and a p-value (p=.023) that is very close to the conventional significance threshold of .05. This suggests the finding is statistically fragile, and the large observed effect size is likely an unstable overestimation that would be difficult to reproduce. While the simple t-test and experienced author are positive signs, they are insufficient to overcome the profound statistical weakness of the original evidence.
---
0.20
The prediction for successful replication is low due to several major weaknesses in the original study. The extremely small sample size (N=8) provides very low statistical power and yields an unstable effect estimate. Additionally, the p-value of 0.023 is only barely significant, and such results are often less likely to replicate than those with more decisive evidence. Most critically, the reported effect size is mathematically inconsistent with the t-statistic, which suggests a statistical error and undermines the overall credibility of the finding.
---
0.25
The primary reason for this low prediction is the extremely small sample size (N=8), which offers very low statistical power and produces noisy, likely inflated, effect estimates. This weakness is compounded by a p-value (0.023) that is close to the significance threshold and a major inconsistency between the reported test statistic and the effect size, which undermines confidence in the results. Although the analysis is simple, these statistical red flags suggest a high probability that the finding is not robust.
---
0.35
The primary reason for the low predicted success is the extremely small sample size (N=8), which makes the finding statistically fragile and highly susceptible to sampling error. While the study benefits from a straightforward within-subjects design and an experienced author, the p-value of 0.023 is only barely significant and is less likely to replicate than a more robust result. Therefore, despite some positive indicators, the statistical evidence is quite weak.
---
0.25
The primary reason for the low replication probability is the extremely small sample size (N=8), which produces statistically unstable estimates and is prone to finding spurious effects. This concern is heightened by the reported p-value (0.023) being close to the significance threshold, suggesting the result is fragile. While the analysis method is simple, these critical statistical weaknesses make a successful replication highly unlikely."

The reported effect size is exceptionally large (ηp² = .427) and the p-value is correspondingly low (p<.001), which are strong indicators of a robust and replicable finding. While the sample size of 37 is small, the powerful within-subjects design and the sheer magnitude of the effect make it highly probable that a replication attempt would succeed. This type of experimental cognitive psychology often yields strong, reliable results.

The extremely low p-value (<.001) and very large effect size (ηp² = .427) are strong indicators of a robust phenomenon, making replication highly likely. While the sample size is small (N=37), which can sometimes lead to inflated effect estimates, the powerful within-subjects design (RM ANOVA) and the sheer magnitude of the reported statistics suggest a true effect exists that would be detectable in a new study. The finding in cognitive psychology, a subfield with often reliable effects, further supports a high probability of replication success.

The prediction is high due to the extremely low p‑value (p < .001) and massive effect size (ηp² = .427), which are strong predictors of replicability. While the sample size is small, the use of a powerful within-subjects design (RM ANOVA) makes this less of a concern than it would be otherwise. The very strong statistical signal suggests a robust underlying effect that is highly likely to be found again in a replication.

This prediction is high due to the exceptionally large reported effect size (ηp² = .427) and the correspondingly low p-value (< .001), which suggest a very robust finding. Although the sample size is small, the within‑subjects design (RM ANOVA) increases statistical power, and an effect of this magnitude is likely to be detected again.

This study has a high probability of replication due to several strong factors. The reported p-value is very low (0.001) and the effect size is medium-to-large (d=0.6), suggesting a robust and non-spurious finding. Critically, the use of a simple paired t-test indicates low analytical flexibility, meaning a replication attempt would likely follow an identical and straightforward analysis plan, increasing the chance of success.

The study has a high probability of replication due to its very low p‑value (p = .001) and a medium‑to‑large effect size (d = 0.6). While the sample size is modest (N=40), the paired t‑test design provided high statistical power for an effect of this magnitude, and the reported statistics are internally consistent. The use of a simple analysis for a core cognitive psychology topic, a subfield with a comparatively strong replication record, further bolsters confidence in the result."

The prediction is high despite the very small sample size (N=24), which is a significant concern for stability. However, this weakness is counteracted by the extremely large reported effect size (ηp² = .51) and highly significant p-value, which suggest a powerful and easily detectable phenomenon.

While the sample size is small, the study reports an exceptionally large effect size (ηp² = .51) and a highly significant p-value, suggesting a very strong signal. More importantly, the abstract states the finding was replicated across five experiments, which substantially increases confidence in the robustness of the core result. The cognitive psychology nature of the study, which often deals with strong manipulations, further supports a high probability of replication.
---
0.65
This prediction balances a very strong statistical signal against a key methodological weakness. The extremely large effect size (ηp^2 = .51) and low p-value (p < .01) suggest a robust phenomenon, but the very small sample size (N=24) means this effect is likely overestimated and carries a higher risk of being a false positive. While a replication would almost certainly find a smaller effect, the original signal is strong enough to suggest a successful replication is more likely than not.
---
0.55
This prediction is moderate due to conflicting signals. The very low p‑value (<.01) and extremely large effect size (ηp² = .51) are strong positive predictors of success. However, the very small sample size (N=24) is a major concern, as it suggests the reported effect may be substantially inflated and less stable than the statistics imply. While a replication is likely to find a smaller effect, the original result is strong enough to suggest an underlying phenomenon will still be detected.
---
0.65
The small sample size (N=24) and the extremely large, likely inflated, effect size (ηp² = .51) are major risk factors for replication failure. However, the reported p-value is very low (p<.01), and the abstract indicates the finding was robust across five separate experiments, which strongly increases confidence in the reliability of the core phenomenon. A replication is therefore more likely than not to succeed, though the observed effect will probably be smaller."

The prediction is low primarily due to the extremely small sample size (N=12) and a p-value on the absolute borderline of significance (an F-value of 4.8 with these degrees of freedom yields p≈.051). Such findings are highly susceptible to random error and have a low probability of replicating, especially since the very large reported effect size is likely an overestimate. While the within-subjects design in cognitive psychology can be powerful, it does not overcome the profound statistical weakness of the primary evidence.
---
0.25
The prediction is low due to the combination of an extremely small sample size (N=12) and a p-value that is just barely below the .05 significance threshold. Such results are statistically weak and have a high probability of being false positives or substantial overestimations of the true effect. Although the reported effect size is large, it is likely inflated by the low statistical power, making a successful replication with a more adequately powered sample unlikely.
---
0.22
The primary reason for the low replication probability is the extremely small sample size (N=12), which produces unstable estimates and has low statistical power. Furthermore, the reported F-statistic of F(1,11) = 4.8 corresponds to a p-value of .051, which contradicts the reported p < .05, suggesting the original result was fragile or misreported. While the reported effect size is large, it is likely an inflation caused by the small sample, and a replication is unlikely to find a statistically significant result.
---
0.15
This prediction is very low due to a convergence of major statistical red flags. The sample size of 12 is extremely small, creating a severely underpowered study where a significant finding has a high chance of being a false positive. Furthermore, the F‑statistic yields a p‑value of .051, meaning the result was not significant by conventional standards and likely misreported. The very large effect size is almost certainly inflated, a common artifact in underpowered studies that obtain a borderline p‑value.
---
0.25
The prediction for a low replication success rate is driven primarily by the extremely small sample size (N=12) and the p-value being very close to the .05 threshold. This combination indicates the study was severely underpowered, which increases the chance of a false positive and suggests the very large reported effect size is likely inflated. Although the experimental paradigm is from cognitive psychology, a field with a decent replication history, the weak statistical evidence of this particular finding is the overriding factor."

This prediction balances a strong test statistic (z=3.10, p≈.002) against a small sample size (N=68) and high analytical complexity. A small sample can lead to inflated effect estimates, and the unusual statistical test (contrast of correlated correlations) on a complex cognitive model may not be robust or could be sensitive to specific assumptions. The lack of a reported effect size further increases uncertainty about the finding's magnitude and stability.
---
0.40
The reported test statistic is strong (z=3.10 corresponds to p≈.002), which is a positive sign for replicability. However, this is offset by several negative factors: the sample size is small, no effect size is reported, and the statistical analysis (""test of contrast of 4 correlated correlations"") is highly complex and unusual. Such complexity can make a finding fragile and difficult for an independent lab to reproduce faithfully, thus lowering the probability of a successful replication.
---
0.35
The predicted replicability is low due to a combination of a small sample size (N=68) and a very complex, unusual statistical analysis. While the reported test statistic is strong (z=3.10, implying p≈.002), results from small samples are often less stable, and complex analyses can capitalize on chance or hide researcher degrees of freedom. The difficulty of precisely recreating the Bayesian cognitive model and the specific ""test of contrast of 4 correlated correlations"" presents a significant barrier to a successful replication.
---
0.42
The prediction is low despite a strong test statistic (z=3.10) because of the small sample size (N=68) and high analytical complexity. Small samples can produce statistically significant but inflated and fragile results, and the complex test of correlated correlations is difficult to replicate precisely and may capitalize on chance. These methodological weaknesses raise concerns about the finding's robustness, outweighing the strong but potentially overestimated evidence.
---
0.55
While the test statistic (z = 3.10) implies a very low p-value (p ≈ .002), which is a strong predictor of success, this is significantly undermined by the small sample size (N=68). A complex analysis on four correlated correlations is prone to instability with so few participants, suggesting the original large effect may be overestimated. The combination of a strong signal with a weak sample yields a moderate probability of replication."

The prediction is moderately high due to the very large reported effect size (ηp² = 0.241) and a strong p-value (<.01), which suggest a robust finding. However, the relatively small sample size (N=67) increases the risk that the true effect is smaller than what was observed. The social psychology context can also involve subtle situational factors that are difficult to reproduce perfectly, tempering confidence in a successful replication.

The strong statistical evidence (p < .01) and very large effect size (ηp² = 0.241) from a standard ANOVA suggest a robust finding. However, the relatively small sample size (N=67) means this effect size is likely inflated, and the subfield of social psychology has a history of mixed replication results. Therefore, while a true effect is probably present, a successful replication is only moderately likely.

The reported p-value is very low (p < .01) and the effect size is very large (ηp² = .241), which are strong predictors of successful replication. However, this impressive statistical evidence was obtained from a small sample (N=67), which suggests the true effect size is likely inflated. Balancing the strong evidence against the sample size limitation and the context-dependent nature of social psychology studies results in a moderately high prediction of success.

The reported p-value is strong (p<.01) and the effect size is very large (ηp² = 0.241), both of which are key positive predictors of replication success. While the sample size of 67 is small for a three-group design and may lead to an inflated effect size estimate, the statistical signal is sufficiently strong to suggest a robust underlying phenomenon. The straightforward ANOVA analysis and experienced lead author further increase the likelihood of a successful replication.

0.35
This low prediction is driven primarily by the combination of a small sample size (N=67) and a very large reported effect size (partial η² = 0.241). Such large effects found in small samples are often statistically overestimated and are less likely to replicate at the same magnitude in a higher-powered study. Furthermore, the study is in social psychology, a subfield with historically lower replication rates, and the effect itself depends on a nuanced social manipulation that can be difficult to reproduce perfectly."

The prediction is moderately high due to the strong reported p-value (p<.01) and, most importantly, the fact that the finding was demonstrated across four separate studies within the paper. However, the relatively small sample size for a hierarchical regression (N=70) introduces uncertainty and increases the risk that the original effect size is overestimated. The study's social psychology context and potentially subtle experimental manipulation could also pose challenges for a direct replication.
---
0.78
The prediction is relatively high due to a combination of a solid p-value (<.01) and a medium effect size (R²=.09), suggesting the finding is not statistically marginal. While the sample size of 70 is only moderate, the study's focus on a methodological issue (structural fit) and its basis in a series of four experiments lend significant credibility to the result. This programmatic approach often leads to more robust and replicable findings.
---
0.62
The primary concern is the small sample size (N=70) for a regression analysis, which increases the likelihood that the reported medium effect size (R²=.09) is an overestimation. However, this is balanced by a strong, theoretically plausible hypothesis regarding methodological fit and a p‑value below .01. The use of a hierarchical regression analysis also introduces minor uncertainty due to its analytical flexibility, but the overall finding seems more likely than not to be robust.
---
0.82
This study has a high probability of replication, primarily because the reported p-value is strong (well below .01, from t(67)=3.08) and the finding was demonstrated across four separate studies, suggesting internal robustness. Although the sample size (N=70) is relatively small for a regression analysis, this concern is mitigated by the medium effect size (R²=.09), the highly-cited first author, and the methodological (rather than counter-intuitive) nature of the claim.
---
0.45
The primary concern is the small sample size (N=70), which can produce unstable and inflated effect estimates, despite the strong reported p-value (p<.01). While the study's methodological argument is plausible, the small N, combined with the study's home in social psychology—a field with historically mixed replication rates—lowers confidence. A replication would be underpowered if the true effect is smaller than the one reported here."

The prediction is very high due primarily to the exceptionally large sample size, which provides immense statistical power and ensures the findings are not a result of sampling error. This statistical certainty is further supported by the very large F‑statistic and highly significant p‑value. Although no effect size is reported, the descriptive, non-counterintuitive nature of the findings in a core area of psychology suggests that a well-powered replication is very likely to succeed.

The likelihood of replication is very high, primarily due to the massive sample size (N > 230,000), which provides extremely stable estimates. This is supported by the very large F‑statistic and the resulting low p‑value, indicating a strong and reliable effect that is not likely due to chance. While a specific effect size is not provided, the strength of the other statistical evidence suggests a robust finding that would almost certainly be detected again in an independent study.

This prediction is very high primarily because of the exceptionally large sample size (N > 230,000), which provides immense statistical power and highly precise estimates. The reported p-value is extremely significant (<.001) with a very large F-statistic, making it highly probable that the observed effect is robust and not a result of random chance.

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
Six studies examined the role of young adults' parental attachment in terror management. Studies 1-3 revealed that activating thoughts of one's parent in response to mortality salience (MS) reduced death-thought accessibility and worldview defense and increased feelings of self-worth. Studies 4-5 demonstrated that MS led to greater ease of recalling positive maternal interactions and greater difficulty recalling negative interactions, and increased attraction to a stranger who was described as being similar to one's parent. If reliance on parents for terror management purposes reflects the operation of attachment mechanisms, then such effects should vary on the basis of an individual's attachment style. Study 6 demonstrated that, after MS, insecure individuals were more likely to rely on relationships with their parents, whereas secure individuals were more likely to rely on relationships with romantic partners.

Note:
Some subfields—such as social or developmental psychology—have historically shown lower replication rates compared to others like clinical or personality psychology, though individual study quality still matters.",0.3,0.25,0.42,0.35,0.15,0.294,"0.30
The predicted probability is low primarily because the reported p-value of 0.03 is very close to the conventional significance threshold; such findings have a lower historical rate of successful replication. This concern is amplified by the relatively small-to-medium effect size, which may be an overestimation, and the study's subfield (social psychology), which has faced challenges with replicability. Although the sample size is adequate and the t-test is a simple analysis, the weakness of the statistical evidence is the dominant factor.
---
0.25
The reported p-value of 0.03 is just below the standard 0.05 threshold, and such marginal results are less likely to replicate successfully. While the analysis is simple, the test statistic implies a small-to-medium effect size that a replication study with a similar sample size (N=100) would be underpowered to detect reliably. Furthermore, the reported effect size (pr^2 = 0.224) is arithmetically inconsistent with the reported test statistic, suggesting a potential error and reducing confidence in the finding.
---
0.42
This prediction is driven primarily by the reported p-value of 0.03, which is close to the conventional significance threshold and indicative of lower replicability. While the moderate sample size and simple t-test analysis are positive factors that increase confidence, the borderline statistical evidence for a finding in social psychology—a subfield with a mixed replication history—suggests a less than 50% chance of a successful replication.
---
0.35
The primary reason for the low replication estimate is the reported p-value of 0.03; results just below the 0.05 significance threshold have a lower probability of replicating successfully. Furthermore, the sample size of 100 provides only modest statistical power for the reported effect, and findings from the subfield of social psychology using mortality salience manipulations have historically shown mixed replication results. While the simple t-test and experienced author are positive indicators, they are outweighed by the statistical fragility of the original evidence.
---
0.15
This study has a low probability of successful replication due to several red flags. The p-value of 0.03 is precariously close to the 0.05 significance threshold, which is often associated with lower replicability. More importantly, there is a large, unexplained inconsistency between the reported test statistic (t=-2.22) and the reported effect size (pr^2=0.224), suggesting the true effect is much smaller and the result is likely fragile. The study's subfield, social psychology, has also demonstrated lower replication rates for these types of effects."

The prediction is low due to several high-risk factors for non-replication. The small sample size (N=36) and a p-value (p=0.02) close to the significance threshold suggest the result may not be robust, and the large effect size is likely an overestimation. Furthermore, the study's topic of broad behavioral priming falls within a subfield of social and cognitive psychology that has historically low rates of successful replication.

0.15
This prediction is low due to several risk factors common in studies that fail to replicate. The small sample size (N=36) provides low statistical power and increases the likelihood of an overestimated effect size, while the p‑value of 0.02 is close to the significance threshold. Furthermore, the study's topic of broad social priming, where subtle cues are claimed to have general behavioral effects, has a well‑documented history of poor replicability.

This study has a low probability of replication due to a combination of risk factors. The very small sample size (N=36) provides low statistical power and suggests the large reported effect size is likely an overestimation. Moreover, the p-value of 0.02 is only weakly significant, and the topic of broad behavioral priming in social psychology has historically demonstrated poor replicability.

0.25
The probability of replication is low due to a combination of a small sample size (N=36) and a p-value (p=0.02) that is close to the significance threshold, which increases the likelihood of a false positive. While the reported effect size is large, it is likely an overestimation due to the low statistical power of the original study. The topic of broad, non-specific behavioral priming has also demonstrated poor replicability in subsequent large-scale replication projects.
---
0.21
This study has a low probability of replication due to its very small sample size (N=36), which provides low statistical power and makes the findings less stable. While statistically significant, the p-value of 0.02 is not highly robust, and the large effect size is likely inflated, a common issue in small-N studies. Moreover, the study's topic of broad social priming is from a subfield that has historically faced significant replication challenges."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
General action and inaction goals can influence the amount of motor or cognitive output irrespective of the type of behavior in question, with the same stimuli producing trivial and important motor and cognitive manifestations normally viewed as parts of different systems. A series of experiments examined the effects of instilling general action and inaction goals using word primes, such as ""action"" and ""rest."" The first 5 experiments showed that the same stimuli influenced motor output, such as doodling on a piece of paper and eating, as well as cognitive output, such as recall and problem solving. The last 2 experiments supported the prediction that these diverse effects can result from the instigation of general action and inaction goals. Specifically, these last 2 studies confirmed that participants were motivated to achieve active or inactive states and that attaining them decreased the effects of the primes on behavior

This study has a moderate sample size and a medium effect size, which are positive indicators for replication. However, the reported p-value of 0.02 is close to the significance threshold where findings are often less robust. Furthermore, the topic of broad behavioral priming falls within a subfield of social-cognitive psychology that has historically faced challenges with replication, making a successful replication less likely.
---
0.25
The study's topic, social priming of behavior with word primes, belongs to a subfield known for significant replication challenges. Furthermore, the reported p-value of 0.02 is close to the conventional significance threshold, a range often associated with a lower likelihood of replication. While the reported effect size is medium, these other factors suggest the original result may be fragile and difficult to reproduce.

0.35
This study's p-value of 0.02 is close to the significance threshold, a factor that is strongly associated with lower replication success. Furthermore, the topic of behavioral priming, a subfield of social-cognitive psychology, has historically demonstrated low replicability. While the reported medium effect size and the straightforward ANOVA design are positive signs, they are not strong enough to overcome the considerable contextual and statistical risks.
---
0.30
This prediction is low because the reported p-value of 0.02 is close to the significance threshold, which is a strong indicator of lower replicability. Furthermore, the study's topic of broad behavioral priming via word cues is characteristic of social psychology research from an era that has since faced a well-documented replication crisis. Although the effect size is medium, these other factors weigh heavily against the likelihood of a successful replication.
---
0.25
This prediction is low because the study combines several factors associated with poor replicability. The topic of social priming has a history of failed replications, and the sample size of 98 is relatively small for a between-subjects design, increasing the risk of a spurious finding. Additionally, the reported p-value of 0.02 is close to the conventional significance threshold, suggesting the evidence may not be robust enough for a successful independent replication."

The reported p-value is significant but close to the conventional .05 threshold, and the effect size is small (η_p² ≈ .04); this combination of marginal statistical evidence is a strong predictor of replication failure. Although the sample size (N=133) is decent for a lab study, it may not have been sufficient to produce a stable estimate of a subtle effect. The finding's plausibility is tempered by the weak statistical support from this specific experiment.
---
0.35
The prediction is low primarily due to the combination of a small effect size (partial η² ≈ .04) and a p‑value (<.02) that is close to the conventional significance threshold of .05. Such findings are often difficult to replicate, as the original result may be an overestimation of the true effect or a chance finding. While the sample size is adequate, the weakness of the statistical evidence for this specific study, combined with the mixed replication record for priming effects in social cognition, suggests a below-average chance of successful replication.
---
0.45
The prediction is moderate-to-low because the reported p-value (<.02) is close to the significance threshold and the effect size (η_p² ≈ .04) is small, both of which are associated with lower replicability. Although the sample size of 133 is decent and the abstract claims the effect was found across five studies, these positive indicators are tempered by the weak statistical evidence from this key test. Furthermore, subtle effects at the intersection of social and cognitive psychology have historically faced replication challenges.
---
0.35
This prediction is low primarily due to the combination of a p-value (<.02) that is close to the significance threshold and a small effect size (ηp² ≈ .04). Such marginal findings are historically less likely to replicate than those with highly significant p-values, as they may reflect a false positive or a substantially overestimated effect. Although the sample size (N=133) is adequate, the subtle nature of the ""affective coherence"" effect, which relies on priming, can be sensitive to minor procedural variations that make successful replication more challenging.

This prediction is low due to several risk factors. The reported p-value (<.02) is significant but close to the .05 threshold, and the effect size is small (η² = .04), both of which are associated with lower replicability. Furthermore, the study's subfield is social psychology and it uses a priming paradigm, a research area that has historically faced significant challenges in direct replication."

This prediction is low due to the small sample size for a between-groups design and a p-value (p=.03) that is only slightly below the conventional significance threshold.

The prediction for a low probability of replication success is driven by the combination of a small sample size and a p-value of .03, which is only slightly below the standard significance threshold. Studies with these characteristics are statistically fragile, as the results are more likely to be influenced by sampling error, and the reported large effect size is likely inflated. The use of a complex mixed ANOVA, which allows for more researcher flexibility, further decreases the likelihood of a successful replication.

The probability of successful replication is low due to the combination of a small sample size for the key analysis and a p-value (p=0.03) that is just below the conventional threshold for significance. Such findings are often fragile and have a high chance of being false positives or substantial overestimations of the true effect. While the first author is well-established, the statistical evidence itself is weak by modern standards, and the complex mixed-design with neural data introduces additional potential for variability.

0.28
The prediction is low primarily due to the combination of a small sample size (N=48, with degrees of freedom suggesting only 33 subjects in the key analysis) and a p-value (0.03) that is just below the conventional threshold for significance. This pattern suggests the study was underpowered, making the large reported effect size likely to be an overestimation that is difficult to replicate. The study's subfield (social psychology) and its use of a complex mixed ANOVA design further contribute to the lower probability of a successful replication."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
The action-based model of dissonance predicts that following decisional commitment, approach-oriented motivational processes occur to assist in translating the decision into effective and unconflicted behavior. Therefore, the modulation of these approach-oriented processes should affect the degree to which individuals change their attitudes to be more consistent with the decisional commitment (spreading of alternatives). Experiment 1 demonstrated that a neurofeedback-induced decrease in relative left frontal cortical activation, which has been implicated in approach motivational processes, caused a reduction in spreading of alternatives. Experiment 2 manipulated an action-oriented mindset following a decision and demonstrated that the action-oriented mindset caused increased activation in the left frontal cortical region as well as increased spreading of alternatives. Discussion focuses on how this integration of neuroscience and dissonance theory benefits both parent literatures.

Some subfields—such as social or developmental psychology—have historically shown lower replication rates compared to others like clinical or personality psychology, though individual study quality still matters.",0.25,0.35,0.32,0.35,0.35,0.324,"0.25
The prediction is low due to several key factors. The most significant is the reported p-value of <.05, which corresponds to an F-statistic that is just barely statistically significant (p ≈ .048); such marginal results have a low historical rate of successful replication. The study's complexity, integrating social psychology theory with demanding neuroscience methods, and the moderate sample size could also contribute to a fragile effect. Although the reported effect size is medium-to-large, it is likely inflated due to the borderline p-value.
---
0.35
The primary concern for replication is the reported p-value of <.05, which, given the F-statistic of 3.19, is very close to the .05 threshold and suggests a fragile result. Although the reported effect size is medium-to-large (ηp² = 0.11) and the author is well-established, this is offset by the marginal statistical significance and the complexity of the neurofeedback paradigm, which can be difficult to implement consistently. A replication attempt could easily yield a non-significant result due to normal sampling variation.
---
0.32
The primary reason for the low replication probability is that the p-value is extremely close to the .05 significance threshold (an F-statistic of 3.19 with the given degrees of freedom yields p≈.049). Such ""just significant"" findings, especially from modest sample sizes, are statistically fragile and often reflect overestimated effect sizes that are less likely to replicate. The study’s use of complex neuroscience methods (neurofeedback, cortical activation) can also introduce unstated procedural variables that make a direct replication more challenging for an independent lab.
---
0.35
The prediction is low primarily because the p-value is extremely close to the .05 significance threshold (an F-value of 3.19 with these degrees of freedom yields p≈.049), a pattern strongly associated with lower replication rates. While the reported effect size is medium-large and the author is highly cited, the borderline p-value coupled with a modest sample size suggests the original finding may be fragile. The study's complexity, integrating social psychology with specialized neuroscience methods, could also introduce challenges for a direct replication.
---
0.35
The reported p-value is very close to the .05 significance threshold, which is a strong negative predictor for replicability. This, combined with a relatively small sample size, suggests the large reported effect size may be an overestimation. The study also involves a complex neurofeedback paradigm that could be difficult to implement precisely in a new lab, further reducing the likelihood of a successful replication."

The prediction is high due to compelling statistical evidence, including a very low p-value (p < .0001) and a large effect size (ηp² = 0.14).

This high prediction is based on very strong statistical evidence; the reported p-value is extremely low (p<.0001) and the effect size is large (ηp²=0.14).

Suggesting that these prototypes are applied to personal relationships when vulnerabilities are expressed, those who claimed to have expressed vulnerabilities doubted the partner's authenticity because they believed that they were viewed as vulnerable (Studies 2A, 2B, and 4). Authenticity doubts in turn predicted perceptions of rejection (Studies 3 and 4), which in turn predicted partner derogation and subsequent expressions of vulnerability (Study 4). An experimental manipulation of reflected appraisals of vulnerability increased doubts about the authenticity of a new acquaintance's expressions of emotion (Study 5).

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
The authors present a model positing that when people are insecure about a relationship partner's acceptance, they often express emotional vulnerabilities to the partner, which causes them to believe the partner views them as highly vulnerable and insecure. In turn, this belief causes them to doubt the authenticity of the partner's expressions of positive regard, which may perpetuate the experience and expression of insecurity that initiated the process. Prototypes of interactions with interpersonally vulnerable individuals included partners' inauthentic expressions of regard (Study 1). Suggesting that these prototypes are applied to personal relationships when vulnerabilities are expressed, those who claimed to have expressed vulnerabilities doubted the partner's authenticity because they believed that they were viewed as vulnerable (Studies 2A, 2B, and 4). Authenticity doubts in turn predicted perceptions of rejection (Studies 3 and 4), which in turn predicted partner derogation and subsequent expressions of vulnerability (Study 4). An experimental manipulation of reflected appraisals of vulnerability increased doubts about the authenticity of a new acquaintance's expressions of emotion (Study 5).

The prediction is low primarily due to the combination of a small effect size (ηp² = 0.028) and a p-value that is close to the significance threshold of .05. While the sample size of 186 is moderate for a within-subjects design, small effects are inherently noisier and more difficult to detect consistently. The complex, multi-step nature of the proposed social-cognitive model may also depend on subtle factors, further challenging direct replication.
---
0.35
The prediction is low primarily due to the combination of a small effect size (ηp^2 = 0.028) and a p-value reported as just meeting the significance threshold (<.05). Such ""just significant"" findings for small effects are often the result of sampling error and frequently fail to replicate, even with a moderate sample size of 186. The complexity of the overarching theoretical model, which posits a multi-step causal chain, also introduces more potential points of failure.
---
0.35
The probability of replication is low primarily due to the combination of a p-value just under the .05 threshold and a small reported effect size (ηp² = 0.028). Such findings are often inflated due to publication bias and have a lower probability of being detected in a new sample, a known challenge within social psychology. The moderate sample size is not large enough to provide strong confidence in the stability of this small effect.
---
0.35
This prediction is based primarily on weak statistical evidence; the p-value is relatively close to the .05 threshold and the partial eta-squared of 0.028 indicates a small effect size. Small effects require large samples to be detected reliably, and while the sample of 186 is not tiny, the study was likely underpowered, which substantially decreases the probability of a successful replication. The complexity of the overall multi-study model presented in the abstract also introduces multiple potential points of failure.
---
0.25
The prediction is low due to the combination of a p-value very close to the .05 significance threshold and a small reported effect size (ηp^2 = 0.028). Such results are often underpowered and have a lower probability of replicating, suggesting the original finding may have been a false positive or an overestimated effect. The study's subfield, social psychology, has also historically demonstrated lower replication rates for findings with similar statistical evidence."

The prediction for high replicability is primarily driven by the extremely strong evidence reported: a very low p-value (<.001) and a very large effect size (R2 = .68). Furthermore, the abstract describes a consistent pattern of results across five studies using varied methodologies (experimental and longitudinal), which functions as a robust internal replication. While multilevel models are complex, the strength of the signal and the moderate sample size suggest the finding is highly likely to be reproduced.
---
0.92
The very small p-value (<.001) and extremely large reported effect size (R² = .68) provide strong evidence for a robust phenomenon that should be easily detectable. While the complexity of a multilevel model introduces some potential for error, the adequate sample size and the internal consistency across the five original studies suggest a high probability of successful replication.
---
0.87
The prediction for successful replication is high due to the combination of a very strong p-value (<.001) and an exceptionally large effect size (R² = .68). While the multilevel model analysis is complex, the decent sample size and the fact that the finding was demonstrated across a programmatic series of five studies suggest a robust effect that is likely to replicate.
---
0.87
The reported p-value is very low (<.001) and the effect size is extremely large (R2 = .68), indicating a statistically robust finding that should be easy to detect again. Although the multilevel model analysis is complex, the strong evidence is bolstered by a series of five studies in the original paper, suggesting the effect has already been internally replicated. The adequate sample size and experienced lead author further increase confidence in a successful replication.
---
0.70
The reported p-value is very low (p<.001), and the effect size is extremely large (R²=.68), which are both strong positive predictors of replicability. However, an effect of this magnitude on a social-psychological question is suspiciously large and may be inflated due to factors like conceptual overlap in the measures. While the sample size (N=153) is adequate for such a large effect, the subfield's historical replication rates and the complexity of a multilevel model introduce uncertainty, tempering the otherwise very strong statistical signals."

This prediction is driven primarily by the reported p-value and resulting statistical power. While the effect size (d=.45) is moderate and the analysis is simple, the p-value is significant but not highly compelling (p≈.02), and the sample size (N=110) offers only modest power to detect an effect of this magnitude. Studies with p-values in this range have historically shown lower replication rates, and a direct replication with a similar sample would have a substantial chance of producing a non-significant result.
---
0.45
The reported p-value is close to the .05 threshold, which is a strong negative predictor for replicability as it suggests the evidence is not overwhelmingly strong. The sample size of 110 provides only modest statistical power to detect the observed small-to-medium effect size (d = .45), increasing the risk of an overestimated effect. While the simple t-test analysis is a positive factor, these statistical weaknesses suggest a less than even chance of successful replication.

0.58
This prediction is moderately above chance due to several competing factors. The simple t-test analysis is a strong positive sign, as it offers little flexibility for p‑hacking. However, the p‑value is just under the .05 threshold, and the study is somewhat underpowered for the reported small-to-medium effect size (d = .45), which increases the risk that the original finding was a false positive or that the effect size is inflated.
---
0.65
The study has several positive indicators for replication, including a moderate sample size, a simple analysis (t-test), and an effect that is well-grounded in an established theory. However, the reported p-value is significant but not highly robust (the calculated p≈.02), and the small-to-medium effect size (d=0.45) means a direct replication has only moderate statistical power. The reliance on an imagination-based manipulation can also be sensitive to subtle variations, slightly tempering the overall confidence in a successful replication.
---
0.42
The prediction is below 50% primarily due to the original study's p-value, which is close to the .05 threshold (p≈.02), and a modest effect size (d=.45); both factors are associated with lower replication rates. While the sample size of 110 is not critically small and the t‑test analysis is simple, the study's location in social psychology—a subfield with historically lower replicability—further tempers expectations."

Note:
Some subfields—such as social or developmental psychology—have historically shown lower replication rates compared to others like clinical or personality psychology, though individual study quality still matters.",0.35,0.42,0.45,0.42,0.42,0.412,"0.35
This prediction is moderate-to-low due to the combination of a small sample size and a p‑value that is close to the conventional .05 threshold. While the reported effect size is medium-to-large, such estimates can be inflated in small samples, and a p‑value of <.02 is not strong evidence. Additionally, the complexity of the 1/f noise analysis introduces potential for hidden methodological factors that could make the novel effect difficult to reproduce consistently.
---
0.42
The prediction is moderate-to-low due to several competing factors. While the sample size is adequate for the reported medium effect size, the p‑value of <.02 is not very strong and falls in a range with historically lower replication rates. Furthermore, the novel application of a complex method (1/f noise analysis) to social psychology introduces analytical flexibility that can make precise replication difficult, increasing the risk of failure.
---
0.45
The study reports a medium effect size (d=.56) and uses a confirmatory analysis (planned contrasts), which are positive signs. However, the p-value is not very low (p < .02) for the moderate sample size, indicating the evidence is not overwhelming. The main risk to replicability is the high complexity of deriving the key dependent variable (1/f noise), as subtle differences in this non-standard procedure could easily lead to a different outcome.
---
0.42
This study's reported p-value of <.02 is only moderately significant, a factor that is strongly associated with lower replication rates. The relatively small sample size (N=71) for a between-subjects design suggests the study may be underpowered and the medium-to-large effect size could be an overestimation. Furthermore, the complexity of calculating the 1/f noise dependent variable could introduce unforeseen challenges or hidden variability in a replication attempt.
---
0.42
The prediction is below 0.5 primarily because the p-value (p < .02) is significant but relatively close to the .05 threshold, which is associated with a lower replication rate. While the effect size is medium (d=.56), the moderate sample size (N=71) provides limited statistical power. Furthermore, the procedural complexity of measuring the dependent variable (1/f noise) could make an exact replication challenging."

The study reports a very low p-value (<.0001) and an extremely large effect size (ηp² = .362), which are the strongest predictors of a successful replication. Although the sample size (N=82) is only modest, the sheer magnitude of the reported effect suggests it is robust and would likely be detected in a new study. The main risk factor is the social cognition subfield, where subtle experimental manipulations can be fragile, but the overwhelming statistical evidence in this case points toward a high probability of success.

This study has a high probability of successful replication due to its extremely low p-value (<.0001) and exceptionally large effect size (ηp² = .362), which suggest a very robust finding. While the sample size of 82 is modest, it is more than adequate to detect such a large effect, and confidence is further increased by the first author's high citation count and the fact that the finding was demonstrated across five separate experiments. The straightforward ANOVA analysis also reduces concerns about questionable research practices influencing the strong result.

0.82
The reported p-value is extremely low (<.0001) and the effect size is very large (ηp² = .362), both of which are strong positive predictors of a successful replication. Although the sample size is modest and findings in social psychology can be sensitive to context, the overwhelming strength of the statistical evidence suggests a robust underlying effect that should replicate. The experienced author and standard analysis further increase confidence."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
People are more forgiving toward transgressors if they see themselves as capable of committing similar offenses, as demonstrated in 7 studies. Methods included hypothetical scenarios, actual recalled offenses, individual and group processes, and correlational and experimental designs. Three factors mediated the link between personal capability and forgiveness: seeing the other's offense as less severe, greater empathic understanding, and perceiving oneself as similar to the transgressor. In terms of predicting forgiveness, it was important that people's own offenses were similar to the target offense in terms of both severity and type. The personal capability effect was independent of other established predictors of forgiveness and was more pronounced among men than women.

The prediction is moderate due to competing factors. While the small sample size (N=45) is a significant risk factor for replication and suggests the large effect size (ηp^2=.186) may be inflated, the strong p-value (p<.01) provides some confidence. Most importantly, the abstract states this is one of seven studies supporting the same conclusion, which suggests the underlying effect is robust and likely to replicate.
---
0.40
The probability is low primarily due to the very small sample size (N=45), which suggests the study was underpowered and the large effect size (ηp²=.186) is likely an overestimation due to the ""winner's curse."" Although the p-value provides moderate evidence (p<.01) and the abstract reports the effect across seven studies, the statistical weakness of this specific finding makes a successful direct replication unlikely.
---
0.35
The primary predictor of failure is the very small sample size (N=45), which suggests the study was underpowered and the resulting large effect size (ηp² = .186) is likely inflated due to the winner's curse. While the reported p‑value is strong (<.01), this is a mathematical consequence of the large effect found in the small sample. A well-powered, independent replication would likely observe a much smaller and potentially non-significant effect.
---
0.55
The small sample size (N=45) is a major concern for replicability, as it increases the risk of a spurious finding and often leads to an overestimation of the effect size. However, this risk is partially offset by a strong p‑value (p < .01) and the fact that the finding is one of seven reported studies, suggesting the phenomenon itself is robust. The combination of weak evidence in this specific experiment and stronger evidence for the overall theory results in a moderate probability of replication.
---
0.35
The primary concern is the very small sample size (N=45), which increases the likelihood that the result is a false positive and that the large effect size is overestimated. Although the p-value is strong (p<.01), a finding's stability is questionable with such a small sample, particularly in a subfield like social psychology which has shown lower replication rates. The true effect is likely smaller, making a successful replication challenging."

The likelihood of successful replication is low. The reported p-value is just under the .05 significance threshold, and such ""barely significant"" findings are known to have a lower replication rate. This weak evidence is coupled with a small effect size (ηp² = 0.035), which suggests that even if the effect is real, the original study's sample size of 122 was likely underpowered to detect it reliably.

The reported p-value is just under the conventional significance threshold of .05, and the effect size is small (ηp² = 0.035), a combination that frequently signals lower replicability. While the sample size of 122 is not tiny, it offers limited statistical power for detecting such a small effect, making a null result in a replication attempt plausible. Furthermore, findings in social psychology, particularly those involving subtle manipulations, have historically shown varied replication success.

0.35
The prediction is low primarily because the reported p-value is very close to the .05 threshold of statistical significance, and the corresponding effect size is small (ηp² = 0.035). This combination suggests the original study may have been underpowered, making the result less robust and potentially an overestimate of the true effect. Consequently, an independent replication has a substantial chance of failing to detect the effect.

The prediction is low because the reported p-value is very close to the .05 significance threshold and the effect size is small (ηp² = 0.035). This combination suggests the original study with its modest sample size was underpowered, which increases the likelihood that the result was a false positive or an inflated estimate of the true effect. While the author is established, this weak statistical evidence makes a successful replication unlikely.

The reported p-value is just under the .05 threshold, which is a strong negative predictor of replicability, especially when combined with a small effect size (partial η² = 0.035). The modest sample size (N=122) provided low statistical power to detect such a small effect, increasing the odds that the original finding was a false positive.

Study 2 found that the pride expression generalizes beyond Western cultures; individuals from a preliterate, highly isolated tribe in Burkina Faso, West Africa, reliably recognized pride, regardless of whether it was displayed by African or American targets. These Burkinabe participants were unlikely to have learned the pride expression through cross-cultural transmission, so their recognition suggests that pride may be a human universal. Studies 3 and 4 used drawn figures to systematically manipulate the ethnicity and gender of targets showing the expression, and demonstrated that pride recognition generalizes across male and female targets of African, Asian, and Caucasian descent. Discussion focuses on the implications of the findings for the universality of the pride expression.

Key details:
- Sample size: 211
- Analysis type (e.g. rm ANOVA, mixed ANOVA, regression, t‑test): binomial test
- Test statistic: X

The prediction is high primarily due to the very large effect size (average recognition proportion of 0.78), which suggests a robust and easily detectable phenomenon. This confidence is bolstered by the use of a simple binomial test and a programmatic series of four studies building a coherent case for universality. While the total sample size is modest and the p-value is reported imprecisely, the sheer magnitude of the effect makes a successful replication highly probable.

0.82
This study has a high probability of replication due to its very large effect size (average proportion of 0.78), which is a strong signal of a robust phenomenon. The analysis is a simple binomial test, which is less prone to error or p‑hacking than more complex methods. While the reported p‑value is weak, it is mathematically inconsistent with the large effect size and sample size, suggesting the overall evidence is much stronger than the p‑value alone implies.
---
0.88
This prediction is high due to a very large effect size (average proportion of 0.78) and a simple, transparent statistical analysis (binomial test), which limits analytical flexibility. While the total sample size is moderate and the p-value is reported imprecisely, the strength of the effect suggests the finding is robust and would have high statistical power. The study's use of converging evidence across multiple diverse populations, including an isolated tribe, further strengthens the likelihood of a successful replication.
---
0.88
This prediction is high primarily due to the very large effect size (average proportion of 0.78), indicating a robust phenomenon that is likely to replicate easily. The research relies on a simple, powerful design and a straightforward statistical analysis (binomial test), which minimizes the potential for methodological or analytical errors. Although the p-value is reported imprecisely, the combination of the large effect and adequate sample size suggests the finding is not a borderline case.
---
0.65
The study reports a strong effect size (78% recognition rate) and uses a simple, transparent analysis (binomial test), both of which are strong positive predictors of replicability. However, the reported p-value is only specified as <.05, which is associated with lower replication rates, and the study is in social psychology, a subfield with historically mixed replication success. The large effect size suggests the finding is likely robust enough to overcome these other cautionary signals."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
People's opinions can deviate from that of the average group member in two ways. Descriptive deviants diverge from the average group attitude in a direction consistent with the desirable group attitude; prescriptive deviants diverge from the average group attitude in a direction inconsistent with the desirable group attitude. Three studies tested the hypothesis that descriptive deviants are more willing to express their opinions than either nondeviants or prescriptive deviants. Study 1 found that college students reported more comfort in expressing descriptive deviant opinions because descriptive deviance induced feelings of superior conformity (i.e., being ""different but good""). Study 2 found that descriptive deviants reported more pride after expressing their opinions, were rated as more proud by an observer, and were more willing to publicize their opinions. Study 3 showed that political bumper stickers with descriptive deviant messages were displayed disproportionately more frequently than were those with prescriptive deviant messages.

The prediction is low due to the combination of a very small sample size (N=37) and a p-value that is just barely below the .05 significance threshold. Such ""just-significant"" findings are often statistical flukes or the result of questionable research practices and have a low probability of replicating successfully. While the analysis is simple, the reported medium effect size is likely an overestimation given the underpowered nature of the study.

The prediction is low due to the combination of a very small sample size (N=37) and a test statistic that is just barely significant at the p<.05 level. Such ""p‑hacking"" adjacent results from low‑powered studies are often not robust and have a high chance of being false positives or inflated effect size estimates. While the reported effect size is medium, the weak evidence for it makes successful replication unlikely.

0.25
The likelihood of successful replication is very low due to the extremely small sample size (N=37) and a reported p-value that is just barely below the .05 significance threshold. Such a finding is statistically fragile, meaning it has a high chance of being a false positive or that the reported effect size (Cramer's V = .322) is a substantial overestimation. While the chi-squared analysis is simple, the foundational evidence is too underpowered to be considered robust.

0.35
The prediction is low due to the combination of a very small sample size (N=37) and a test statistic (X^2 = 3.85) that is just barely significant at the p<.05 level. This suggests the result is statistically fragile and at high risk of being a false positive or an overestimated effect that would not be significant in a new sample. While the analysis is simple and the conceptual framework seems coherent across three studies, the weak statistical evidence for this specific finding makes a successful replication unlikely.
---
0.25
The predicted probability of replication is low due to multiple risk factors. The sample size (N=37) is very small, offering low statistical power, and the test statistic (X^2=3.85) yields a p‑value extremely close to the .05 significance threshold, a combination strongly associated with replication failure. These primary issues, along with the study’s placement in social psychology—a subfield with historically lower replication rates—suggest the finding is likely not robust."

This study has several positive indicators, including a reasonably strong p-value (<.01) and a sample size (N=246) that provides adequate statistical power for the effect found. The use of four separate studies to establish the phenomenon also strengthens the conceptual claim. However, the effect size is small (ηp²=0.041), and such interaction effects in social psychology can be sensitive to subtle contextual factors that are difficult to reproduce perfectly, tempering the overall likelihood of a successful direct replication.
---
0.62
The study has a reasonably large sample size and a p-value that is more than marginally significant, which are positive indicators for replication. However, the effect size is small-to-medium, and complex interaction effects in social psychology can be sensitive to subtle contextual differences not captured in a direct replication. These factors temper the otherwise positive statistical evidence, suggesting a better-than-even but not certain chance of success.
---
0.65
This prediction is moderately high due to the strong p-value (p<.01) and a reasonably large sample size (N=246) for this type of study. However, the effect size is small-to-medium (ηp²=0.041), and the finding is a nuanced interaction effect, which can be more difficult to replicate than a simple main effect. The straightforward ANOVA analysis is a positive sign, but the subtlety of the psychological manipulation introduces some risk.
---
0.55
While the study has a respectable sample size and a strong p-value (p<.01), its effect size is small-to-medium (ηp²=0.041), making it more susceptible to sampling error. The primary challenge to replication is the complex interaction effect, which relies on successfully manipulating both goal framing and commitment level. Such nuanced psychological effects, particularly in social psychology, can be sensitive to subtle contextual differences and are often more difficult to replicate than simple main effects.
---
0.42
The prediction is moderate-to-low due to the small reported effect size (ηp² = 0.041), which can be difficult to detect reliably without a very large sample. While the p-value is strong (p < .01), the finding is a complex two-way interaction within social psychology, a subfield where subtle effects are often sensitive to minor variations in study context. These factors combined suggest a below-average chance of a successful replication."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
The authors investigated whether an implemental mind-set fosters stronger attitudes. Participants who made a decision about how to act (vs. those who held off) expressed a more extreme attitude toward an issue unrelated to the decision (Experiment 1). Participants who planned the implementation of a decision (vs. deliberated vs. control) exhibited less ambivalent (Experiment 2) and more accessible (Experiment 3) attitudes toward various objects unrelated to the decision. Moreover, an attitude reported by planning participants better predicted self-reported behavior 1 week later (Experiment 4). Finally, results suggest that the effect of an implemental mind-set on attitude strength toward unrelated objects is driven by a focus on information that supports an already-made decision (Experiment 5). Implications for attitudes, goals, and mind-sets are discussed.

The prediction is low due to the combination of a very small sample size (N=46) and a p-value just below the .05 threshold. Such underpowered studies often produce unstable results and inflated effect sizes, making the large reported effect (ηp² = 0.135) suspect. Additionally, findings involving subtle mind‑set manipulations have historically shown mixed replicability.
---
0.25
The primary reasons for this low prediction are the very small sample size (N=46) and the marginal p-value (p<.05), which suggests the study had low statistical power. This combination makes the result more likely to be a false positive or a substantial overestimation of the true effect size. Findings from underpowered studies with p-values close to the significance threshold have historically shown low rates of successful replication.

0.35
This prediction is low primarily due to the combination of a small sample size (N=46) and a p-value that is very close to the significance threshold of .05. Such a result is statistically fragile, and the large reported effect size is likely inflated due to the low statistical power of the original study. A replication would probably observe a smaller, more realistic effect, which would not be statistically significant with a similar small sample.

0.22
The prediction is low due to the very small sample size (N=46), which provides low statistical power, and a p-value (<.05) that is just barely below the significance threshold (actual p ≈ .043). This combination suggests a high risk of being a false positive, and the large reported effect size (ηp² = 0.135) is likely an overestimation common in underpowered studies. Additionally, ""mindset"" effects within social psychology have historically shown low rates of successful replication.

This prediction is low due to the combination of a very small sample size (N=46) and a p-value just below the significance threshold of .05. Studies with low statistical power that find marginal significance are less likely to replicate, and the reported large effect size is likely inflated. Furthermore, the abstract describes a subtle mindset effect in social psychology, a subfield where similar priming-style studies have historically shown lower replication rates."

The prediction is based on a combination of strong and moderate factors. The reported p-value is associated with an F-statistic (F(1,90)=6.98) that yields an actual p-value of approximately .01, a strong predictor of replicability. Furthermore, the medium effect size (ηp² = .07) suggests a robust phenomenon, and the simple between-subjects ANOVA is a straightforward analysis. While the sample size of 94 is not large, the solid statistical evidence from the original study supports a high likelihood of successful replication.

This prediction balances a medium effect size (ηp² = .07) and a p-value that is significant but not extremely low against a moderate sample size and the study's subfield. Social psychology findings, particularly those involving complex manipulations as implied by the abstract, have historically shown variable replication success. While the statistical evidence is decent, the N=94 sample may not be large enough to produce a highly stable effect estimate, creating uncertainty about its robustness.

This study has several strong indicators of replicability, most notably a medium effect size (ηp² = .07) and its establishment across a series of four experiments in the original paper. While the sample size is moderate and the reported p-value is imprecise, the effect size is substantial enough and the finding was internally replicated, suggesting it is not a statistical artifact. The simple between-subjects ANOVA also reduces concerns about analytical flexibility influencing the result.

The prediction is moderately high due to a solid medium effect size (ηp² = .07) and a p‑value (≈.01) well below the typical cutoff, suggesting a non-fragile result. Most importantly, the abstract reports four successful studies supporting the core hypothesis, which serves as a strong form of internal replication. While the sample size is modest and the subfield (social psychology) has shown variable replication rates, the strong evidence within the paper itself boosts confidence."

The predicted likelihood of replication is low due to multiple statistical red flags. The study has a small sample size (N=50) for a correlational design, and the p-value is just below the conventional threshold for significance (p<.05), both of which are strong predictors of replication failure. Additionally, the use of a partial correlation controlling for what is likely several unmentioned variables (given the degrees of freedom) increases the potential for overfitting and finding a spurious result that is not robust.
---
0.25
The low sample size (N=50) and a p-value just under the standard .05 threshold are strong indicators of low replicability, as they suggest the finding may not be robust. Furthermore, the partial correlation analysis controlled for a large number of variables (seven, as inferred from the degrees of freedom), which is a complex model for a small dataset and increases the risk of a spurious result. Although the reported effect size is moderate, it is likely an overestimation due to these factors, making a successful replication improbable.

The predicted replication success is low due to several converging factors. The sample size is small for a correlational design, and the reported p-value is just under the .05 threshold, suggesting the result may not be robust. Most critically, the use of a partial correlation with a large number of covariates (implied by the degrees of freedom) relative to the sample size increases the risk of an unstable, overfitted finding that is unlikely to hold in a new sample.

The small sample size (N=50) and a p-value just below the .05 threshold are strong negative predictors of replicability, suggesting the original result may have been a false positive or an overestimated effect. Furthermore, the use of a partial correlation with a high number of covariates relative to the sample size increases the likelihood of a spurious finding. While the author is established, these statistical weaknesses point to a low probability of successful replication.

When confronted with 10 pieces of information, decision makers systematically preferred decision-consistent information, whereas when confronted with only 2 pieces of information, they strongly preferred decision-inconsistent information (Study 1). This effect was not due to differences in processing complexity (Study 2) or dissonance processes (Study 3) but could be traced back to different salient selection criteria: When confronted with 2 pieces of information, the salient selection criterion was information direction (consistent vs. inconsistent), which caused a preference for inconsistent information.

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
Empirical evidence on selective exposure to information after decisions is contradictory: Whereas many studies have found a preference for information that is consistent with one's prior decision, some have found a preference for inconsistent information. The authors propose that different available information quantities moderate these contradictory findings. Four studies confirmed this expectation. When confronted with 10 pieces of information, decision makers systematically preferred decision-consistent information, whereas when confronted with only 2 pieces of information, they strongly preferred decision-inconsistent information (Study 1). This effect was not due to differences in processing complexity (Study 2) or dissonance processes (Study 3) but could be traced back to different salient selection criteria: When confronted with 2 pieces of information, the salient selection criterion was information direction (consistent vs. inconsistent), which caused a preference for inconsistent information. In contrast, when confronted with more than 2 pieces of information, the salient selection criterion was expected information quality, which caused a preference for consistent information (Study 4).

The reported p‑value is very low (0.001) and the effect size is very large (d=1.16), both of which are strong positive predictors of replicability. However, the small sample size (N=52) is a major weakness, as such studies are prone to finding inflated and unstable effects. The simple chi-squared analysis is a plus, but the low sample size substantially increases the risk that the true effect is smaller and the original result was a statistical artifact.
---
0.78
The reported p-value is very low (p=0.001) and the effect size is very large, which are strong positive indicators for replication. However, the small sample size (N=52) is a significant concern, as findings from underpowered studies can be unstable and effect sizes can be inflated. The simple chi-squared analysis and the fact that the finding is supported by a series of four studies are strengths that increase confidence in the result.
---
0.55
The prediction balances strong but competing factors. The very low p‑value (p=.001) and large effect size are strong positive predictors of replication success. However, the extremely small sample size (N=52) is a major weakness that suggests the effect may be overestimated, and the nuanced interaction-style finding is often less robust than a simple main effect.
---
0.75
The study reports a highly significant p-value (0.001) and a very large effect size (d > 1), which are strong predictors of replication success. However, these promising metrics are derived from a very small sample (N=52), which increases the risk that the reported effect size is inflated and that the finding is not robust. While the simple analysis and experienced author are positive signs, the small sample size significantly tempers confidence in an otherwise strong statistical result.
---
0.40
While the reported p-value is very low (p = .001), the small sample size (N=52) raises a major concern, as it can produce unstable and inflated effect size estimates. The very large reported effect size (d ≈ 1.17) is likely an overestimation due to this small sample, a phenomenon known as the ""winner's curse."" The study's location in social psychology, a subfield with historically lower replication rates, and its focus on a complex interaction further decrease confidence in a successful replication."

This study's reliance on the ""ego depletion"" paradigm is a major weakness, as this specific research area has faced a severe replication crisis with many foundational findings failing to replicate. The reported p-value of .02 is only marginally significant, and such results are statistically less likely to replicate than stronger evidence. This p-value, combined with the moderate sample size, suggests that the large reported effect size is likely an overestimation, making a successful replication improbable.
---
0.25
This prediction is low primarily because the study is based on the concept of ego depletion, a theory that has performed very poorly in large-scale, pre-registered replication attempts. Furthermore, the reported p-value of 0.02 is relatively close to the .05 significance threshold, and the sample size is modest for a between-subjects design, both of which are risk factors for non-replication. While the reported effect size is medium-to-large, such estimates from small studies are often inflated, making the finding's robustness questionable.

0.25
The prediction is low primarily because the study is based on the ego depletion framework, a subfield with a well-documented history of replication failures. This theoretical concern is amplified by the study's weak statistical evidence; the small sample size (N=85) and a p-value of 0.02, which is close to the significance threshold, suggest the reported medium-to-large effect size is likely an overestimation that would not hold in a higher-powered replication.

0.15
The prediction is low primarily because the study is based on the theory of ego depletion, a subfield with a well-documented history of replication failures. This core concern is compounded by the marginal p-value (p = .02) and the relatively small sample size for a between-subjects design. These weaknesses suggest a high risk that the finding is a false positive and are not overcome by the reported moderate effect size or the author's experience.

0.15
The prediction is low due to several converging factors that are strong predictors of replication failure. The study's topic, ego depletion, is a concept from social psychology that has performed very poorly in large-scale replication attempts. Furthermore, the reported p-value of 0.02 is close to the significance threshold of .05, and the small sample size (N=85) for a between-subjects design suggests the study was underpowered, likely resulting in an inflated effect size."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
Four studies investigate the role that stereotype threat plays in producing racial distancing behavior in an anticipated conversation paradigm. It was hypothesized that the threat of appearing racist may have the ironic effect of causing Whites to distance themselves from Black conversation partners. In Study 1, participants distanced themselves more from Black partners under conditions of threat, and this distance correlated with the activation of a ""White racist"" stereotype. In Study 2, it was demonstrated that Whites' interracial distancing behavior was not predicted by explicit or implicit prejudice. Study 3 provides evidence that conceiving of interracial interactions as opportunities to learn may attenuate the negative consequences of threat for Whites. Study 4 found that Whites have conscious access to their experience of stereotype threat and that this awareness may mediate the relationship between threat and distance. These results are discussed within a broader discourse of racial distancing and the possibility that certain identity threats may be as important as prejudice in determining the outcomes of interracial interactions.

Some subfields—such as social or developmental psychology—have historically shown lower replication rates compared to others like clinical or personality psychology, though individual study quality still matters.",0.35,0.35,0.6,0.35,0,0.33,"0.35
While the reported p-value is strong (p<.01) with a large effect size (ηp² = .16), the small sample size (N=55) for a between-subjects design raises significant concerns about the stability and accuracy of this estimate. Social psychology findings on subtle topics like stereotype threat are often highly context-dependent and have shown mixed replication success historically. The combination of a small sample and a large effect suggests a high risk that the finding is either a false positive or an overestimated effect that will be substantially smaller or non-significant in a replication attempt.
---
0.35
The primary concern is the small sample size (N=55) for a between‑subjects design, which provides low statistical power and suggests the large reported effect size (ηp² = .16) may be inflated. While the p‑value is strong (<.01), subtle behavioral findings in social psychology related to stereotype threat have often proven difficult to replicate. The combination of a small sample and a context‑sensitive effect lowers the predicted chance of a successful replication.
---
0.60
The reported p-value (<.01) and large effect size (η_p² = .16) are strong positive indicators for replication success. However, these results are derived from a very small sample size (N=55) for a between‑subjects design, which significantly increases the risk that the true effect is overestimated. The prediction is therefore moderate, balancing the strong statistical signal against the low power and reliability of the original study.
---
0.35
Although the reported p‑value is strong (<.01) and the effect size is large, the study’s very small sample size (N=55) for a between-subjects design is a major weakness that makes it vulnerable to false positives and inflated effect size estimates. The subject matter—stereotype threat—is also known to be highly sensitive to subtle contextual factors, which can make the specific effect difficult to reproduce reliably in a different setting. These factors combine to suggest a lower probability of successful replication despite the strong initial statistics.

The study's primary claim is a null finding (p = .48), which is a claim that an effect is absent. The reported effect size is extremely small (r = .04), suggesting that even a well-powered replication is highly unlikely to find a statistically significant effect. Therefore, a successful replication, defined as one that also fails to find a significant sex difference, is very probable.
---
0.78
The reported p-value of .48 and trivial effect size (r = .04) provide strong evidence for a null effect, which is often more likely to replicate than a borderline-significant finding. Although the extremely complex statistical analysis introduces uncertainty and potential fragility, the original effect is so weak that a replication is highly likely to confirm the absence of a meaningful sex difference. Therefore, a successful (i.e., null) replication is probable.
---
0.92
The study’s central claim is a null finding (p = .48), which is strongly supported by a trivially small effect size (r = .04). Replicating a null effect is highly probable when the original effect is so close to zero, as even a well-powered replication is unlikely to find a significant result. Although the analysis is complex, the weakness of the signal makes it very likely that a replication attempt would yield a similar non-significant outcome.
---
0.85
The original study reports a very clear null finding (p = .48) with a trivial effect size (r = .04), which provides strong evidence for the absence of the effect in question. A successful replication would also find a non-significant result, and given the tiny original effect, this is highly probable in a new sample. While the analytical complexity and social psychology subfield are minor risk factors, the sheer weakness of the original effect makes it very likely to replicate as a null finding."

However, confidence is tempered by the moderate sample size (N=91) and the complexity of both the theory and the hierarchical regression analysis. Such factors can sometimes indicate that a finding is less stable than it appears, particularly in a field like social psychology where interaction effects can be difficult to replicate.

This prediction is based on the reasonably strong evidence from the original study, including a p-value well below .05 and a medium effect size (sr² = .07). However, confidence is tempered by the modest sample size (N=91) for a hierarchical regression analysis and the complexity of a nine-study paper, which introduces more flexibility in analysis. While the finding is theoretically grounded, studies in social psychology have historically shown variable replication rates.
---
0.65
The reported p-value is strong (p<.01) and the effect size is moderate (sr²=.07), which are favorable predictors of replication success. However, the sample size of 91 is somewhat small for a hierarchical regression, which increases the risk that the original effect was inflated and could be difficult to reproduce. The complexity of the multi-study theory in social psychology also adds a degree of uncertainty, tempering the otherwise positive statistical signals.
---
0.75
This prediction is optimistic primarily because the abstract reports a series of nine studies that conceptually replicate and support the model, suggesting the effect is robust and not a one-off finding. Although the effect size is small‑to‑medium (sr^2 = .07) and the study is in social psychology—a subfield with historically lower replication rates—the strong p‑value (<.01) and the programmatic evidence from multiple internal replications substantially increase confidence in a successful independent replication."

The reported p-value is just under the conventional .05 threshold, which, combined with a very small sample size (N=28), signals low statistical power and a high risk of being a false positive. While the reported effect size is large, such estimates are often inflated in underpowered studies. The simple t-test analysis is a positive factor, but it is heavily outweighed by the weak evidence suggested by the other key metrics.

This study has a very low probability of replication due to its extremely small sample size (N=28), which provides low statistical power and an unstable effect size estimate. The p-value is just under the .05 threshold (and a recalculation of the provided test statistic actually yields p=.07), indicating a fragile finding that could easily be a false positive. While the reported effect size is large, such estimates are often inflated in small, underpowered studies.
---
0.15
The probability of replication is very low due to the extremely small sample size (N=28), which provides insufficient statistical power and leads to imprecise estimates. Furthermore, the reported p-value is questionable, as the given test statistic yields a two-tailed p-value of approximately .07, which is not statistically significant. A finding with such weak evidence, even if it had been reported as marginally significant, is highly unlikely to replicate in a new, independent sample.
---
0.15
The reported p-value (<.05) is inconsistent with the test statistic (t(26) = 1.87), which yields a p-value of approximately .072. This critical discrepancy, combined with the very small sample size (N=28) and consequently low statistical power, suggests the original result may be a false positive. These factors, along with the study’s origin in social psychology—a subfield with historically lower replication rates—make a successful replication highly unlikely."

The prediction is high due to the combination of a very strong p-value (p=0.001) and a large effect size (ηp²=.143), suggesting a robust and easily detectable effect. While the sample of 90 is only moderate, it was more than sufficient for an effect of this magnitude, as shown by the strong F-statistic.

This study has a high probability of replication success, primarily driven by its highly significant p-value (p = .001) and a large reported effect size (ηp² = .143). Although the sample size is moderate, it was clearly sufficient to detect an effect of this magnitude. The straightforward ANOVA analysis and the first author's high citation count further increase confidence in the robustness of the finding.

The prediction is high due to the very strong statistical evidence; the reported p-value is low (p=.001) and the partial eta-squared effect size is large (ηp²=.14). While the sample size is only moderate (N=90), the strength of this reported effect suggests it is robust and would likely be detected again in a well-powered replication. The use of a standard ANOVA is straightforward, reducing the risk of complex analytical errors that could hinder reproducibility."

The reported p-value of 0.05, derived from a test statistic that is technically not significant (p > .05), is a primary indicator of low replicability. This weak evidence is compounded by a small effect size (phi = .13), which suggests the original study was underpowered and a replication would have a low probability of success without a much larger sample. While the analysis is simple, these statistical weaknesses, situated in a subfield known for fragile effects, point toward a low likelihood of replication.
---
0.20
The p-value of exactly 0.05 provides only marginal evidence against the null hypothesis, and studies with p-values near the significance threshold have a lower probability of replicating. This weak evidence is coupled with a small effect size (phi = .13). Furthermore, the study investigates a subtle psychological manipulation (cognitive fluency) within social cognition, a subfield where such effects have historically been difficult to replicate reliably.
---
0.25
The primary reason for this low prediction is the reported p-value of 0.05, which indicates the result is statistically marginal and highly susceptible to sampling error. This fragility is compounded by the small effect size (phi = .13), which would require a much larger sample than the N=236 used here to be detected reliably in a replication. While the simple chi-squared analysis is a positive factor, the combination of a marginal p-value and a small effect in a subfield known for subtle effects suggests a low probability of replication success.
---
0.25
The prediction is low due to the combination of a p-value on the boundary of statistical significance (p = .05) and a small effect size (phi = .13). Results that are ""just significant"" have a lower probability of successful replication, as they suggest the original evidence was statistically weak. While the sample size is moderate, it provided low statistical power to reliably detect such a small effect, further decreasing confidence in the finding.
---
0.25
The primary reasons for this low prediction are the statistically fragile p-value of 0.05 and the small effect size (phi = .13). A result exactly at the significance threshold is highly likely to yield a non-significant p-value in a replication due to normal sampling variation. Furthermore, the small effect size implies the original study was likely underpowered, and that subtle priming effects from social cognition have historically proven difficult to replicate."

The primary risk for replication failure is the very small sample size (N=36), which makes the findings less stable. This weakness is compounded by a p-value that, while significant, is relatively close to the .05 threshold, suggesting the result is not statistically robust. Although the reported effect size is large, such effects are often overestimated in small samples and may shrink below significance in a replication attempt.
---
0.48
This study’s small sample size (N=36) and p-value just under the conventional threshold for significance (p<.05) are strong indicators of low replicability. While the reported effect size is large (d=0.82), such estimates are often inflated in small samples. The combination of a small sample and a p-value that is not highly significant suggests the original finding may not be robust enough to replicate successfully.
---
0.45
The study reports a large effect size, which is a positive indicator for replicability. However, this is counteracted by a small sample size (N=36) and a p-value (p≈.02, calculated from the F-statistic) that is not overwhelmingly significant, a combination which can lead to overestimated effects and lower replication rates. While the experimental design appears sound and theoretically motivated, the statistical evidence from this single study is not robust enough to warrant high confidence in a successful replication.
---
0.45
The prediction is modest due to conflicting signals. While the reported effect size is large (d = 0.82), the small sample size (N = 36) and a p-value just under the conventional threshold for significance increase the likelihood that the original result was a false positive or that the effect is substantially overestimated. Studies on young children can also be sensitive to subtle procedural variations, adding another layer of uncertainty to a replication attempt.
---
0.35
The primary concern is the small sample size (N=36), which provides low statistical power and increases the likelihood that the large reported effect size is inflated. This, combined with a p-value that is significant but not overwhelmingly so, suggests the finding may not be robust. Developmental studies with young children can also be sensitive to minor procedural variations, further reducing the chances of a successful replication."

Specifically, two experiments, using markedly different implicit-learning paradigms, demonstrated facilitation of implicit learning when the goal of achievement was primed. We propose that nonconscious goal pursuit can facilitate not only reproductive operations, but also productive ones, and that implicit learning is sensitive to the organism's nonconscious goals.

- Test statistic: t(84) = 2.09

Some subfields—such as social or developmental psychology—have historically shown lower replication rates compared to others like clinical or personality psychology, though individual study quality still matters.",0.22,0.28,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,"0.22
This study's reported p-value is just below the conventional .05 significance threshold, a characteristic strongly associated with lower replication rates. The relatively small sample size for a between-subjects design suggests the study was underpowered and the reported effect size is likely an overestimate. Furthermore, the topic of nonconscious goal priming has a well-documented history of replication difficulties, as such effects are often highly sensitive to subtle variations in experimental context.
---
0.28
The probability is low primarily because the test statistic (t(84) = 2.09) corresponds to a p-value of approximately .04, which is only narrowly significant; such findings have a much lower historical rate of successful replication. Furthermore, the sample size (N=86) provides low statistical power to reliably detect the reported small-to-medium effect size, increasing the likelihood that the original result was a chance finding. The study's topic, nonconscious priming, also comes from a subfield that has historically faced replication challenges.
---
0.25
The probability of replication is low due to several risk factors. The reported p‑value is very close to the .05 significance threshold (a t‑statistic of 2.09 with 84 df corresponds to p=.039), which is associated with lower replicability. The sample size of 86 provides low statistical power for the reported small‑to‑medium effect size, increasing the chance the original result was a false positive or an overestimation. Finally, the topic of nonconscious goal priming is from a subfield that has historically struggled with replication.

0.25
The reported p-value is just below the conventional .05 threshold, a characteristic strongly associated with lower replication success. The study also investigates a subtle social priming effect, a research area known for replication difficulties. Furthermore, the moderate sample size provides relatively low statistical power to reliably detect the reported small-to-medium effect size, increasing the chance that the original result was a statistical artifact.
---
0.25
The predicted probability of replication is low due to a combination of high-risk factors. The reported p-value is just below the .05 significance threshold (a t-statistic of 2.09 yields p≈.04), which is associated with lower replication rates. This marginal result, found in a study with a relatively small sample size and from a subfield (social priming) with a history of replication challenges, suggests the original finding is likely fragile or the effect size is overestimated."

This study has a very high probability of successful replication due to its extremely large effect size (ηp² = .326) and correspondingly high F‑statistic, which are supported by a solid sample size. Such strong statistical evidence suggests a robust phenomenon that is not likely to be a chance finding. While the social-cognitive nature of the study implies some complexity in the stimuli, the sheer magnitude of the reported effect makes a successful replication highly probable.

The probability of replication is very high due to the overwhelming statistical evidence, including a reasonably large sample size, an extremely small p-value (p<.001), and a massive effect size (ηp² = .326). The use of a standard General Linear Model for the key analysis also suggests the result is not an artifact of analytical flexibility. These factors combine to suggest the reported effect is robust and highly likely to be detected in an independent study.

0.94
This study has an extremely high probability of replication due to the convergence of several strong positive indicators. The reported p-value is very low (<.001) and the effect size is exceptionally large (partial η² = .326), both of which are key predictors of a robust and replicable finding. This strong statistical evidence is further supported by a large sample size (N=280), which reduces the likelihood that the result is due to sampling error.

The prediction is high due to a strong p-value (p≈.01 based on the F-statistic), a medium-to-large effect size, and the fact that the paper presents five studies supporting the conclusion. This finding builds on the very robust anchoring phenomenon from cognitive psychology, which increases confidence in the underlying mechanism. While the small sample size and a significant inconsistency between the reported F-statistic and effect size (η²) are points of concern, the overall weight of evidence suggests the finding is likely replicable.
---
0.75
This prediction is moderately high because the study investigates a robust phenomenon (anchoring) and is part of a five-study paper, which suggests the finding is reliable. However, the specific study’s evidence is somewhat weak, with a small sample size (N=59) and a p-value (p≈.01, inferred from the F-statistic) that is not overwhelmingly significant. These factors suggest the effect size may be overestimated, creating a moderate risk of failure in a direct replication.
---
0.75
The study benefits from investigating a robust phenomenon within cognitive psychology and presenting a series of five experiments, which suggests internal replication and strengthens confidence in the finding. However, the relatively small sample size (N=59) and a p-value that is significant but not extremely low (~.01, based on the F-statistic) introduce uncertainty. While the effect is likely real, a direct replication of this specific study is not guaranteed due to potential overestimation of the effect size in the small sample.
---
0.85
The p-value (p ≈ .01, inferred from the F-statistic) and the corresponding medium-to-large effect size suggest a solid finding, despite the small sample size. This study investigates a classic, robust cognitive bias, and the fact that the original report contained five successful experiments provides strong evidence of internal validity. These positive factors outweigh the risk associated with the small sample, making a successful independent replication highly likely.
---
0.84
The prediction is high because the finding was demonstrated across five separate studies, which provides strong internal replication and makes a fluke result highly unlikely. Although the sample size (N=59) for any single experiment is modest, the implied p-value is solid (p≈.01) and the core phenomenon of anchoring is a very robust effect in cognitive psychology. The multi-study design is the most important factor and strongly suggests the effect is real and replicable."

Here, we document, for the first time, the pull toward contrasting responses during evaluative thinking, reporting the results of a study examining the trajectory of participants' reaching movements toward different response options. The data for this study come from 141 college-age participants (97 females, 44 males) who responded to 11 yes/no questions presented in random order over headphones. The questions were derived from propositions in the Internet-based Mindpixel project and had varying truth values (defined as the proportion of participants who responded that they were true). These results show that both the spatial extent and the temporal dynamics of motor movements can provide insight into high-level cognition. Our results are consistent with previous claims regarding proposition verification. Specifically, we found that evaluating a proposition as false exhibits more difficulty compared with evaluating a proposition as true. Not only were ""NO"" responses slower than ""YES"" responses, but the ""YES"" alternative conspicuously competed with the ""NO"" alternative. Thus, reasoning about the truth value of a proposition exhibits a significant a priori bias toward ""truth,"" and this bias must be overcome before a ""false"" response can come to fruition.

- Sample size: 141
- Analysis type (e.g. rm ANOVA, mixed ANOVA, regression, t‑test): ANOVA
- Test statistic: F(1, 9) = 8.7
- Reported p‑value: <.05

- First author’s citation count: 233

Note:
Some subfields—such as social or developmental psychology—have historically shown lower replication rates compared to others like clinical or personality psychology, though individual study quality still matters.",0.35,0.3,0.35,0.65,0.25,0.38,"0.35
The primary reason for the low replication prediction is the reported test statistic, F(1, 9) = 8.7. While the participant sample size (N=141) is adequate, the test's denominator degrees of freedom (9) is extremely low, indicating the statistical test had very little power and is based on a small number of data points (likely items, not participants). Although the reported effect size is large (r=-0.7), discovering such a large effect with such a low-powered test suggests it may be a significant overestimation and is unlikely to replicate robustly.
---
0.3
The reported degrees of freedom (df = 9) are extremely low for a study with 141 participants, suggesting the analysis was likely run on the 11 study items instead of the participants, making the test severely underpowered. This, combined with a p-value that is just barely significant (p<.05), points to a high probability that the very large reported effect size is an overestimation. A direct replication with a more appropriate analysis (e.g., a mixed-effects model) would likely find a much smaller, non-significant effect.
---
0.35
The primary reason for this low prediction is the statistical test, F(1, 9), which indicates that the analysis was likely performed across a very small sample of items (N≈11), not across the 141 participants. This represents a severely underpowered design, making the result less reliable despite the large reported effect size, which itself may be an overestimation due to the small sample. Furthermore, the analysis of motor trajectories offers considerable researcher flexibility in defining variables, and the imprecise p-value (<.05) is often associated with findings that are not robust.
---
0.65
The reported effect size is very large (r = -0.7) and the sample size is substantial (N=141), both of which strongly favor replicability. However, the reported ANOVA degrees of freedom (df = 1, 9) are highly unusual for a study with 141 participants and suggest a much weaker item-level analysis was performed across a small number of stimuli. While the large effect implies a robust underlying phenomenon, this questionable statistical inference significantly increases the risk that the finding is not generalizable and would fail to replicate.
---
0.25
The primary concern is the statistical analysis, as the reported F‑statistic (with 9 denominator degrees of freedom) indicates an item‑level analysis was likely performed despite a large participant sample (N=141), thereby ignoring substantial participant‑level variance. While the reported effect size is very large (r = ‑0.7), it is likely an inflated estimate resulting from this inappropriate analysis. Consequently, the finding may be an artifact of the specific stimuli used and is unlikely to generalize in a replication attempt with new materials."

This study has a very high probability of replication due to the combination of an extremely large effect size (d = .93) and a highly significant result (t = 10.36, implying p < .001). The simple, transparent analysis (single-sample t‑test) and adequate sample size (N=125) further reduce the likelihood that this finding is a statistical artifact or dependent on complex, difficult-to-replicate procedures. An effect of this magnitude is robust and should be readily detectable in a direct replication.
---
0.95
This study has a very high probability of successful replication due to the convergence of multiple strong signals: a large effect size (d = .93) was found in a decent sample (N = 125), resulting in an extremely large test statistic and a very small p-value. Furthermore, the simple analysis (single-sample t-test) reduces the likelihood of complex, difficult-to-replicate interactions or hidden methodological artifacts.
---
0.95
This study has an extremely high probability of replication due to several strong factors. The reported effect size is very large (d = .93), and the test statistic (t = 10.36) indicates a highly significant p-value, suggesting a robust and easily detectable effect. Furthermore, the use of a simple single-sample t-test minimizes analytic flexibility, and the sample size is sufficient to lend high precision to the estimate.
---
0.94
This study has a very high probability of replication success due to the combination of a large effect size (d = .93) and an overwhelmingly significant test statistic (t = 10.36). The analysis is a simple t-test, which is easy to replicate and less prone to statistical artifacts, and the sample size (N=125) is more than adequate to reliably detect such a strong effect. These factors together indicate a highly robust finding.
---
0.95
The reported effect size (d = .93) and its associated test statistic are exceptionally large, suggesting a very robust finding that is unlikely to be a statistical fluke. This strong evidence, combined with a straightforward analysis (single-sample t-test) and an adequate sample size, makes it highly probable that a replication would also detect this powerful effect. While social psychology has shown variable replication rates, the overwhelming evidence for this specific effect makes a successful replication highly likely."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
Episodic memory enables individuals to recollect past events as well as imagine possible future scenarios. Although the episodic specificity of past events declines as people grow older, it is unknown whether the same is true for future events. In an adapted version of the Autobiographical Interview, young and older participants generated past and future events. Transcriptions were segmented into distinct details that were classified as either internal (episodic) or external. Older adults generated fewer internal details than younger adults for past events, a result replicating previous findings; more important, we show that this deficit extends to future events. Furthermore, the number of internal details and the number of external details both showed correlations between past and future events. Finally, the number of internal details generated by older adults correlated with their relational memory abilities, a finding consistent with the constructive-episodic-simulation hypothesis, which holds that simulation of future episodes requires a system that can flexibly recombine details from past events into novel scenarios.

Key details:
- Sample size: 32
- Analysis type (e.g. rm ANOVA, mixed ANOVA, regression, t‑test): RM ANOVA
- Test statistic: F(1,30) = 14.49
- Reported p‑value: prep = .99
- Effect size (e.g. Cohen’s d, r): __p^2= 0.326
- First author’s citation count: 6138
- Subfield: Cognitive, Social

Note:
Some subfields—such as social or developmental psychology—have historically shown lower replication rates compared to others like clinical or personality psychology, though individual study quality still matters.",0.92,0.85,0.82,0.75,0.72,0.812,"0.92
The study reports an extremely large effect size (ηp² = .326) and a highly significant p‑value (p < .001, based on the F‑statistic), which are the strongest predictors of replication success. While the sample size of 32 is small, which can increase the risk of an overestimated effect, the sheer magnitude of the finding suggests the underlying effect is robust. The study also extends a previously replicated finding within cognitive psychology, lending it strong theoretical support.

0.85
The study reports a very large effect size (ηp² = 0.326) and a highly significant test statistic (F(1,30) = 14.49), which strongly suggest a robust effect. While the sample size of 32 is small and risks overestimating the effect, the sheer magnitude of the finding makes it likely to replicate successfully. The result is also a plausible extension of a previously replicated finding (age-related decline in past-event specificity), which increases confidence in its validity.
---
0.82
The probability of replication is high due to the exceptionally large effect size ($\eta_p^2$=.326) and the correspondingly low p-value (p<.001), which suggest a robust phenomenon. While the small sample size (N=32) introduces uncertainty and risk of an overestimated effect, the sheer strength of the reported signal makes a successful replication likely. The finding also aligns with established theory and replicates a known effect, further boosting confidence.
---
0.75
This prediction is driven by the very strong statistical evidence, including a large effect size (ηp² = .326) and a highly significant p-value (p < .001, calculated from the F-statistic), which are strong predictors of replication success. However, the small sample size (N=32) is a significant weakness, as it can lead to inflated and less stable effect size estimates. Nevertheless, the statistical signal is so strong and the finding is a logical extension of previous work, suggesting the effect is likely robust enough to replicate despite the limited sample.
---
0.72
The prediction is moderately high due to the very strong statistical evidence; the reported p-value is extremely low (p < .001) and the effect size (ηp² = 0.326) is very large. However, this confidence is substantially tempered by the very small sample size (N=32), which increases the risk that the reported effect is an overestimation and may not be stable. The reliance on subjective coding of interview data could also introduce variability in a replication attempt."

This prediction is moderately optimistic primarily due to the strong p-value (p≈.003, calculated from the reported t-statistic), which is a key predictor of replicability. However, the very small sample size (N=32) is a significant weakness, as it creates a wide margin of error around the effect size and increases the chance of a Type I error. While the simple t-test and experimental design are positive signs, the risk associated with the small sample significantly tempers the likelihood of successful replication.
---
0.62
The reported p-value is quite strong (the t-statistic corresponds to p≈.003), and the medium effect size is plausible, which are positive signs for replicability. However, the very small sample size (N=32) is a major concern, as it increases the chance that the original effect size was overestimated and lowers statistical power. While the simple analysis (t-test) is a minor plus, the low sample size significantly tempers the optimism from the strong p-value.
---
0.70
This study has a good chance of replicating due to its strong statistical evidence (a t-statistic of 3.23 corresponds to p < .01) and simple analysis (t-test), which reduces concerns about p-hacking. While the sample size (N=32) is small, which increases the risk of an overestimated effect size, the medium effect (d=.571) and the study's foundation in the generally robust subfield of cognitive development suggest the finding is not a fluke. The core finding is plausible and builds on established theories of language acquisition.
---
0.45
While the reported p-value is low (p ≈ .003, inferred from the t-statistic), a strong positive predictor, this is counteracted by a very small sample size (N=32). Small samples produce less stable estimates and can inflate the observed effect size, increasing the risk that a well-powered replication would find a smaller, non-significant effect. Additionally, studies involving live interaction with young children can be difficult to replicate due to procedural sensitivity.
---
0.60
This prediction balances the strong statistical evidence (p ≈ .003, calculated from the t‑statistic) against a significant methodological weakness. A small sample size of 32 increases the risk that the reported medium effect size is inflated, making it harder to detect in a replication attempt. Studies involving very young children can also introduce variability that complicates replication, though the simple analysis (t‑test) is a positive factor."

This study has a high probability of successful replication due to its adequate sample size, strong statistical evidence (p < .01, t = 3.94), and simple, transparent analysis (dependent t-test). The powerful within-subjects design and the study's basis in the well-established ""wisdom of crowds"" effect lend it theoretical plausibility. While the effect size is moderate (d = 0.47), it is substantial enough that a well-powered replication should detect it.

This study has a high probability of replication due to its simple within‑subjects design and standard statistical analysis (dependent t‑test), which reduces researcher degrees of freedom. The statistical evidence is strong, with a low p-value (p<.01) and a substantial effect size (d=0.47) for the moderate sample size (N=173). Furthermore, the experimental paradigm is straightforward and easy to implement, which generally leads to more robust and replicable findings.

The probability of replication is high due to a combination of strong statistical evidence and a simple design. The very low p-value (<.01) and medium effect size (d=0.47) in a decently-sized sample (N=173) suggest a robust finding. Furthermore, the use of a simple dependent t-test and a straightforward experimental procedure leaves little room for analytic flexibility, increasing the likelihood that an independent replication would observe the same effect.

This study has a high likelihood of replication due to its strong statistical evidence, including a p-value well below .01 and a solid sample size (N=173) for its powerful within‑subjects design. The analysis is a simple dependent t‑test on a plausible cognitive phenomenon, which reduces the risk of implementation errors in a replication attempt. Finally, the first author is highly cited, which is modestly associated with more robust findings.

This study has a high probability of successful replication. It employs a simple within-subjects design with a standard analysis (dependent t-test), which reduces the risk of error. The statistical evidence is solid, with a reasonably strong p-value (p<.01) and a plausible, medium-sized effect (d=0.47) supported by a decent sample size for this design."

This study has a high probability of replication due to its extremely strong statistical evidence, including a very low p-value (<.00001) and a very large effect size (ηp² = .308). While the sample size is dangerously small (N=12), the study uses a powerful within-subjects design to investigate a robust phenomenon in cognitive psychology. The sheer magnitude of the reported effect suggests it would likely be detected again in a direct replication, even if its size is overestimated in the original report.

The reported effect is supported by an extremely small p-value and a very large effect size (ηp² = .308), suggesting a highly robust finding. Although the sample size of 12 is very small, this is less concerning in the context of a within-subjects cognitive paradigm like the attentional blink, which typically yields strong effects and has high statistical power. The combination of powerful evidence from a well-controlled experiment on a classic phenomenon makes replication highly probable.

This study reports an extremely small p-value and a very large effect size (ηp^2 = .308) for a core interaction, which are strong positive predictors for replicability. While the sample size of 12 is very small, this is partially mitigated by the use of a within‑subjects ANOVA design on a robust cognitive phenomenon (the attentional blink), where each participant provides a large amount of data. The combination of very strong evidence for a large effect in a well-established paradigm suggests a high likelihood of successful replication.

The study reports an extremely low p‑value (<.00001) and a very large effect size (partial eta-squared = .308), which are strong indicators of a robust and replicable finding. While the sample size of 12 is very small, this is often mitigated in within-subjects cognitive paradigms like the attentional blink, where many trials per participant yield high statistical power. The fact that the study investigates a classic, well-established phenomenon in a controlled laboratory setting further increases the likelihood of a successful replication.

The probability of replication is very high due to the overwhelming statistical evidence, including a massive effect size (ηp² = .308) and an extremely low p‑value. Although the sample size is small, this is common for within‑subjects cognitive studies where power is derived from many trials per participant, as suggested by the large error degrees of freedom. The study investigates a classic, robust phenomenon (the attentional blink), further increasing confidence in the finding."

This study investigates the glucose model of ego depletion, a hypothesis from social psychology that has performed exceptionally poorly in large-scale replication attempts. While the p-value is significant (p ≈ .023 based on the F-statistic), it is not highly compelling and falls in a range that has a lower replication rate. The sample size provides low statistical power to detect the reported small-to-medium effect size, suggesting the original finding may be overestimated and difficult to reproduce.

The study tests the glucose model of ego depletion, a hypothesis from social psychology that has famously failed to replicate in large, pre-registered multi-lab studies. The reported p-value, calculated from the F-statistic, is approximately .023, which is close to the .05 threshold and suggests the evidence is not very strong. A small effect size (ηp² = .045) combined with a modest sample for this design indicates the original study was likely underpowered, increasing the probability that the finding was a false positive.

0.15
This prediction is low due to the study's topic and statistical details. The glucose model of ego depletion is a prominent theory that has largely failed to replicate in large-scale studies, making the foundational hypothesis questionable. Furthermore, the reported p-value (calculated as p ≈ .023 from the F-statistic) is close to the .05 threshold and the effect size is small (ηp² = .045), which together suggest the original result may not be robust.

0.15
This study's central hypothesis, the glucose model of self-control, is part of the ""ego depletion"" literature, which has a well-documented history of failed replications. The statistical evidence is also fragile, with an F-statistic corresponding to a p-value just below the .05 threshold (p ≈ .023) and a small-to-medium effect size. Findings that rely on complex interaction effects, such as this one, are also known to be less robust and harder to replicate than simpler main effects.

0.15
The study's theoretical foundation in ego depletion and its link to blood glucose is a major concern, as this is a subfield of social psychology with a well-documented history of major replication failures. While the sample size is moderate, the reported p-value is close to the significance threshold (p≈.023) and the effect size is small-to-medium (ηp² = .045), suggesting the result may not be robust. The surprising claim that a simple physiological manipulation (a sugary drink) has a direct impact on a complex cognitive bias is the type of finding that often proves difficult to replicate."

We found that (a) the defensive startle response was larger following errors than following correct responses, and (b) the magnitude of the ERN predicted the degree of startle potentiation following errors. Thus, response errors prime defensive motivation-and the ERN predicts individual differences in the aversive response to errors.

The primary reasons for this low prediction are the small sample size (N=31) and the p-value being just below the conventional .05 threshold. These factors suggest the study had low statistical power, and the reported medium effect size is likely an inflation of the true effect due to publication bias (the ""winner's curse""). While the zero-order correlation is a simple analysis, the weak statistical evidence makes a successful replication improbable.
---
0.40
This study has a high risk of non-replication due to its small sample size (N=31) and a p-value just below the conventional threshold for significance. These factors result in low statistical power and high uncertainty around the reported effect size, meaning the original finding may be a fragile, overestimated effect. While the analysis is straightforward and the effect size is moderate, the weak statistical evidence makes a successful replication unlikely.
---
0.42
This study's low sample size (N=31) and a p-value just under the conventional .05 threshold are strong negative predictors for replicability. Although the effect size is medium, it is likely an overestimation due to the low statistical power of the original study. While the simple, transparent correlational analysis is a positive sign, the weak statistical evidence makes a successful replication improbable.
---
0.28
The prediction is low primarily due to the small sample size (N=31) and a reported p-value just under the .05 significance threshold. This combination suggests the study had low statistical power and that the reported medium effect size (r = -.38) is likely an overestimation of the true effect. While the first author is well-cited and the analysis is simple, these major statistical weaknesses strongly indicate a low probability of successful replication.
---
0.35
The primary risk factors for replication failure are the small sample size (N=31) and the p‑value just below the conventional .05 threshold. This combination suggests the study was underpowered, and the reported medium effect size is likely an overestimation due to sampling error. Individual difference correlations in social and cognitive neuroscience often require much larger samples to produce a stable and replicable result."

Despite a highly significant p-value, the probability of replication is low due to the extremely small sample size (N=12). Such a small sample makes the results highly unstable and likely produced a massively inflated effect size (d=3.25), a common issue in underpowered studies. The complexity of fMRI analysis and data processing also introduces potential variability that can make findings difficult to reproduce.
---
0.75
While the sample size of 12 is very small, the statistical evidence is exceptionally strong, with a very low p-value (derived from t(11) = 5.39) and a massive effect size. The tiny sample means the effect size estimate is likely inflated, but the strength of the signal suggests a genuine underlying effect that would likely be detected in a well‑powered replication. The use of a simple t‑test for the core claim also adds to confidence, despite the overall complexity of an fMRI study.
---
0.35
This study's primary weakness is its extremely small sample size (N=12), which makes the findings highly susceptible to sampling error and can produce dramatically inflated effect size estimates. Although the reported effect size is massive (d=3.25) and the p-value is consequently low, such extreme results from tiny samples are often not robust. While the statistical analysis itself is simple, the underlying fMRI methodology involves complex preprocessing choices that could further complicate replication efforts.

0.15
The extremely small sample size (N=12) and the implausibly large effect size (d = 3.25) are primary red flags for replicability. In underpowered studies, statistically significant results often reflect dramatically inflated effect estimates or Type I errors. While the reported p-value is very low, it is a direct consequence of the extreme effect size and does not guarantee the finding is robust.
---
0.25
The primary predictor of low replicability is the extremely small sample size (n=12), which makes the finding highly unreliable. This likely led to a massively inflated effect size (d=3.25), a common issue in underpowered studies. While the p-value is very low, its meaningfulness is severely undermined by the small sample, and the study's subfield (social psychology) has shown lower replication rates historically."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
The representation of visual information inside the focus of attention is more precise than the representation of information outside the focus of attention. We found that the visual system can compensate for the cost of withdrawing attention by pooling noisy local features and computing summary statistics. The location of an individual object is a local feature, whereas the center of mass of several objects (centroid) is a summary feature representing the mean object location. Three experiments showed that withdrawing attention degraded the representation of individual positions more than the representation of the centroid. It appears that information outside the focus of attention can be represented at an abstract level that lacks local detail, but nevertheless carries a precise statistical summary of the scene. The term ensemble features refers to a broad class of statistical summary features that we propose collectively make up the representation of information outside the focus of attention.

This prediction is low due to several statistical weaknesses. The primary concern is the extremely small sample size (N=8), which produces unstable estimates and is highly susceptible to sampling error. Furthermore, the p-value (p=0.028) is just below the conventional significance threshold, a range often associated with lower replication rates. Although the reported effect size is large, it is likely an overestimate biased by the small sample, making the finding's robustness questionable despite the simple analysis.

This study's primary weakness is its extremely small sample size (N=8), which provides very low statistical power and produces highly uncertain estimates. Although the reported effect size is large, such effects are often inflated in underpowered studies, and the p-value (p=0.028) is close enough to the conventional 0.05 threshold to warrant skepticism. While the simple analysis (t-test) and plausible cognitive phenomenon are positive signs, the weak statistical evidence makes a successful replication less likely than not.
---
0.35
The primary reason for the low predicted replication success is the extremely small sample size (N=8), which makes the finding highly unreliable. While the reported effect size is very large, with such a small sample this estimate is likely inflated, and the p-value (0.028) is close enough to the 0.05 threshold to be considered fragile. A well-powered replication would likely observe a smaller, more precise effect that may not reach statistical significance.
---
0.62
The prediction is moderately optimistic due to several competing factors. The very large reported effect size and the study’s origin in cognitive psychology—a subfield with higher replication rates—are positive indicators. However, the extremely small sample size (N=8) makes the findings highly uncertain and the resulting p-value (p=0.028) is not far from the significance threshold, which substantially lowers confidence in the result.
---
0.65
While the extremely small sample size (N=8) and a p‑value (0.028) close to the significance threshold are major risk factors, the study has several strengths that favor replication. The reported effect size is very large (dz=0.976), and the simple t‑test analysis is straightforward to reproduce. Most importantly, the abstract states the finding was consistent across three experiments, suggesting the effect is robust despite the low power of any single experiment."

This study has a very low probability of replication due to a combination of severe weaknesses. The sample size (N=36) is exceptionally small for a between-subjects design, resulting in low statistical power and an unstable estimate. Consequently, the large reported effect size (ηp² = 0.147) is likely highly inflated, and the finding itself (p ≈ .02, inferred from the F-statistic) is not robust. Studies of this type, involving subtle social manipulations, have historically demonstrated poor replicability.

The prediction is low due to the very small sample size (N=36), which provides insufficient statistical power and increases the risk of a false positive. While the effect size is large, small-N studies often produce inflated effect estimates, and the corresponding p-value (p≈.02, inferred from the F-statistic) is not strong enough to warrant high confidence. Social psychology studies involving subtle experimental manipulations can also pose challenges for successful replication.

The prediction is low due to several major risk factors. The sample size (N=36) is extremely small for this type of design, which provides low statistical power and leads to unstable and likely inflated effect size estimates. While the reported effect is large (ηp² = 0.147), such findings from small social psychology studies are known to replicate poorly, and the p-value is not overwhelmingly strong (p ≈ .02).

The primary predictor of a low replication probability is the extremely small sample size (N=36), which suggests the study was severely underpowered and that the large reported effect size is likely a substantial overestimation. While the result was statistically significant (the reported p-value statistic corresponds to p ≈ .02), this level of evidence is weak when drawn from such a small sample.

The prediction is high due to the very strong evidence in the original study, including a large effect size (d = -0.94) and a highly significant p-value (p < .0001). Furthermore, the study investigates a basic perceptual phenomenon using a simple and powerful within-subjects design, a combination that generally yields robust results. While the sample size is modest, the sheer magnitude of the reported effect and the simplicity of the analysis make a successful replication highly probable.

This prediction is very high because the study reports extremely strong statistical evidence: a very small p‑value and a large effect size (d = -0.94). Furthermore, the use of a powerful within‑subjects design based on a classic perceptual illusion and a simple, transparent analysis (paired t‑test) greatly increases confidence in the finding's robustness. The relatively small sample size is a minor concern that is largely overcome by the strength of the effect.

This study has a very high probability of replication due to its extremely low p‑value and large effect size (d = -0.94). The simple analysis (paired t‑test) and a classic perceptual paradigm (motion aftereffect) suggest a robust, controlled experimental finding. These strengths significantly outweigh the potential weakness of a modest sample size.

This study has a very high probability of replication due to its extremely low p‑value and large effect size (d = ‑.94), which indicate a robust finding. The study uses a powerful within‑subjects design (paired t‑test) to test a perceptual illusion, a type of phenomenon that is often stable across contexts and replications. Although the sample size is modest, the statistical evidence is exceptionally strong, suggesting the effect is not a statistical artifact.

The prediction is very high due to the extremely significant p‑value and large effect size (d = -0.94), which are the strongest statistical predictors of replicability. This confidence is further bolstered by the use of a simple, transparent analysis (paired t‑test) on a within‑subjects design in cognitive perception, a subfield known for robust effects. While the sample size is modest, it is more than sufficient to detect an effect of this magnitude."

The prediction is low due to the extremely small sample size (N=28), which provides low statistical power and leads to unstable and likely inflated effect size estimates. Furthermore, the reported test statistic corresponds to a p‑value very close to the .05 significance threshold, and such “just‑significant” findings are known to have a lower probability of replication. The study also investigates a complex interaction effect, which is inherently more difficult to replicate than a simple main effect.
---
0.22
The study’s very small sample size (N=28) provides low statistical power, making the results highly susceptible to sampling error and likely to have an inflated effect size. The reported test statistic, F(1, 26) = 4.17, corresponds to a p-value of approximately .051, which is weak evidence that is unlikely to replicate. Furthermore, the key finding is a complex interaction effect, which is typically more difficult to reproduce than a simple main effect.
---
0.15
The predicted probability is very low due to multiple strong indicators of poor replicability. The sample size (N=28) is extremely small for a mixed ANOVA design, which severely limits statistical power and the stability of the results. Critically, the reported test statistic F(1, 26) = 4.17 corresponds to a p‑value of .051, which is not statistically significant, and the large effect size is likely inflated. The complexity of the interaction effect being tested further reduces the chances of a successful replication.
---
0.15
This prediction is low due to several major risk factors for replication failure. The study has a very small sample size (N=28), which provides low statistical power and increases the chance of finding an inflated effect size. Most critically, the test statistic yields a p-value of approximately .051, which is at the threshold of statistical significance and is a strong predictor of non-replication. Furthermore, the complex interaction effect found in a mixed ANOVA design is inherently more difficult to reproduce than a simple main effect.
---
0.15
This study has a very high risk of non-replication due to its extremely small sample size (N=28), which provides very low statistical power to detect a complex interaction. The reported F-statistic yields a p-value slightly above the conventional .05 significance threshold, and the use of the `prep` statistic—a now-disfavored metric—likely obscures this marginal result. The large effect size is probably an overestimation common in underpowered studies, making the finding unlikely to be reproduced in a larger, more robust replication attempt."

The primary factor lowering the replication probability is the very small sample size (N=25), which makes the findings unstable and increases the chance they are a false positive. While the reported p-value is strong (p < .005) and the effect size is large (__p^2 = .18), these impressive metrics are highly suspect when obtained from such an underpowered study due to effect size inflation (the ""winner's curse""). The subtle social-cognitive nature of the phenomenon could also make it sensitive to minor procedural differences in a replication attempt.
---
0.38
While the reported p-value is low and the effect size is large, the study's very small sample size (N=25) is a significant weakness that lowers the chance of successful replication. Such a small sample increases the likelihood that the observed large effect is an overestimation due to sampling error and would not be found in a larger, more powerful replication attempt. The complexity of the social interaction effect, which may be sensitive to subtle variations in stimuli or participants, adds another layer of uncertainty.
---
0.35
The primary concern is the very small sample size (N=25), which makes the reported large effect size (__p^2 = .18) and low p‑value (<.005) less trustworthy and likely to be inflated. While a controlled lab study is a positive sign, the subtle social-cognitive phenomenon and the complex mixed ANOVA increase the risk that the finding is not robust. An independent replication with a larger, more adequately powered sample would likely find a much smaller effect, if any.
---
0.35
The primary reason for this low prediction is the very small sample size (N=25), which makes the finding less stable and suggests the large reported effect size (ηp² = .18) is likely an overestimate. While the reported p‑value is strong (<.005), the complex social paradigm involving eye‑tracking of reactions to a video stimulus may be sensitive to subtle contextual factors, making it difficult to replicate precisely.
---
0.35
The prediction is low primarily due to the very small sample size (N=25), which increases the risk of a false positive and suggests the large reported effect size may be inflated. While the p‑value is strong (p<.005), the study's focus on a complex interaction within the subfield of social psychology—which has historically faced replication challenges—lowers confidence in the finding's robustness. The nuanced nature of the stimulus and the finding itself may also make it less likely to replicate consistently."

This prediction is low primarily due to the combination of a very small sample size (N=24) and a p-value (p≈.025, based on the F-statistic) that is just barely significant. While the reported effect size is large and the within-subjects cognitive paradigm is generally well-controlled, findings based on small, low-powered samples with p-values close to .05 are often statistically fragile and less likely to replicate successfully.
---
0.70
The study's primary weakness is its very small sample size (N=24), which reduces confidence in the stability of the findings and means the p-value (p≈.025, based on the F‑statistic) is not highly compelling. However, this is offset by a very large reported effect size (ηp² = .20) and the use of a within-subjects design to test a cognitive memory phenomenon. Such effects are often robust, suggesting that while the original study's effect size is likely inflated, the underlying effect is probably real and would be detected in a replication.

0.82
This study investigates the survival processing effect, a well-established and robust phenomenon in cognitive psychology, which is a strong predictor of replicability. Although the small sample size (N=24) and the p-value being close to the .05 threshold (p≈.025 for the reported F-statistic) are risk factors, they are outweighed by the large reported effect size and the strong prior evidence for this effect. Therefore, a well-powered independent replication is highly likely to find a significant result in the same direction.
---
0.85
This study has a high predicted probability of replication primarily due to its exceptionally large reported effect size (ηp² = .20), which suggests a very robust phenomenon within a standard cognitive paradigm. Although the small sample size (N=24) and the corresponding p-value being relatively close to the significance threshold (p≈.025) are notable risks, an effect of this magnitude is powerful enough that it is very likely to be detected again in an independent study. The high citation count of the author also lends some confidence to the methodological quality.
---
0.45
The primary concern is the very small sample size (N=24), which yields low statistical power and increases the chance that the large reported effect size (ηp²=.20) is an overestimation. While the within-subjects design is strong, the calculated p-value (p≈.025) is not far from the .05 threshold. A better-powered replication would likely find a smaller, potentially non-significant effect, making the original finding's replicability uncertain despite the established author."

The reported effect size is small (pr = .21), and the sample size is also small for a correlational study (N = 119), leading to an unstable estimate with a wide confidence interval. The reported `prep` value of .92 corresponds to a p‑value near the traditional .05 threshold for significance, and such ""just significant"" findings are often less likely to replicate. Although the analysis is straightforward and the author is well-established, the combination of a small effect and low statistical power makes a successful replication improbable.

This prediction is low due to the combination of a small effect size (pr = .21) and a modest sample size (N=119). The reported p-value statistic (prep = .92, which corresponds to p ≈ .02) is statistically significant but falls within a range that has been shown to have a low replication rate. While the author is highly cited and the analysis is straightforward, the statistical evidence is not strong, suggesting the initial result may be an overestimate and a replication study could easily yield a smaller, non-significant finding.

0.40
The primary concern for replication is the small effect size (pr = .21) found with a modest sample size (N=119), which suggests the original study was underpowered and the result could be a statistical artifact. While the original authors reported a high probability of replication (`prep` = .92, corresponding to p ≈ .01), this metric is now considered unreliable and overly optimistic. The combination of a small, potentially unstable effect and a complex analysis involving mediation makes a successful replication less likely.
---
0.35
This prediction is based on the combination of a small effect size (pr = .21) and a relatively small sample size (n = 119) for a correlational design. Such a combination increases the likelihood that the original finding is a type I error or that the effect size is overestimated, reducing the probability of a successful replication. Although the author is well-established, the statistical evidence is not robust, with a p-value that is likely significant but not highly convincing (calculated to be just under .05).
---
0.35
The reported effect size is small (pr = .21) and the sample size (N=119) provides low statistical power to reliably detect it. Most critically, the reported `prep` = .92 statistic corresponds to a p-value just barely below the conventional .05 threshold, and such borderline results are known to have a low replication rate. These statistical weaknesses suggest the original finding may have been a false positive or an overestimated effect, making a successful replication unlikely."

After learning about positive and negative behaviors performed by one individual from each of two different groups, participants were introduced briefly to new individuals from the groups. Implicit evaluations of the original individuals readily generalized to the new individuals; explicitly, participants resisted such generalization. Days later, both implicit and explicit evaluations of the original individuals generalized to the new individuals. The results suggest that associative links (e.g., shared group membership) are sufficient for implicit attitude generalization, but deliberative logic (e.g., individual group members are not necessarily the same) can reduce explicit generalization by association. When knowledge distinguishing who did what is unavailable, such as after forgetting, associative knowledge provides the basis of explicit evaluation. We conclude that a simple association linking one individual to another can produce implicit attitude generalization immediately and explicit attitude generalization eventually.

Despite the large sample size, which typically suggests stability, the reported statistics indicate an extremely weak and non-significant finding. The effect size (d = -0.004) is virtually zero, and the test statistic (t = -0.11) corresponds to a p-value of approximately .91, providing very strong evidence for a null effect. A successful replication (typically defined as finding p < .05) is therefore exceedingly unlikely, as the original study found no evidence of an effect to be replicated.

Despite the very large sample size, the reported evidence for an effect is exceptionally weak. The test statistic (t = ‑0.11) and effect size (d = ‑0.004) are both virtually zero, and the reported `prep` of .18 indicates a very high p‑value (~0.91), strongly suggesting a null result. It is therefore highly unlikely that an independent replication would find a statistically significant effect.

0.01
The original study’s key reported statistic was not significant, with a t-value near zero, a negligible effect size (d = -0.004), and a very high p-value (p ≈ .91, inferred from the t-statistic). Even with a large sample, the study found virtually no effect for this specific test. A replication is therefore extremely unlikely to find a statistically significant result, which is the standard definition of replication success.
---
0.01
The reported effect size (d = -0.004) and t‑statistic (t = -0.11) are both negligibly small, indicating a clear null finding for this specific test. Although the original study had a large sample (N=564) and thus high power to detect an effect, it found none. Therefore, the probability of a replication achieving success (conventionally, p < .05) is exceptionally low.

0.05
The study's reported effect size is negligible (d = -0.004) and the test statistic is exceptionally weak (t = -0.11), corresponding to a highly non‑significant p‑value. Although the large sample size (N=564) adds precision, it only strengthens the conclusion that the true effect is likely zero. Therefore, an independent replication is extremely unlikely to achieve a statistically significant result."

The extremely small sample size (N=30) provides low statistical power and suggests the large reported effect size (d=0.88) is likely inflated due to random error. Furthermore, social psychology studies relying on subtle priming manipulations to influence behavior have a well-documented history of low replicability.

The prediction is low due to the extremely small sample size, which suggests the study was underpowered and the very large reported effect size is likely inflated. While the p-value is strong, social priming studies of this nature have a poor track record for replicability. These factors combined suggest that a replication attempt is unlikely to succeed.
---
0.2
The primary concern is the very small sample size (N=30), which provides low statistical power and suggests the reported large effect size (d=0.88) is likely inflated. Findings from studies with such low power, especially in social psychology research involving behavioral priming, have historically low replication rates. While the simple t-test analysis is a positive factor, the combination of a small sample and an unusually large effect makes a successful replication highly improbable.
---
0.25
The primary reason for the low replication probability is the very small sample size (N=30), which yields low statistical power and makes the result highly vulnerable to sampling error. Consequently, the very large reported effect size (d = .88) is likely an overestimation, as subtle priming manipulations of this kind often have smaller or null effects in larger, more robust studies. The weaknesses of the small sample are not overcome by the significant p-value or the author's reputation.
---
0.25
The extremely small sample size (N=30) for a between-subjects design is a major red flag, as it makes the results highly unstable and prone to false positives. Consequently, the very large reported effect size (d=0.88) is likely inflated, and this type of behavioral priming study in social psychology has a well-documented history of replication failures. While the reported p-value is strong, its credibility is severely undermined by the small sample."

The extremely small sample size (N=4) makes the finding’s stability highly questionable, as results from such a tiny group are very susceptible to sampling error.

The extremely low sample size of four participants is the primary concern, making the finding highly susceptible to sampling error and questioning its generalizability. While the reported p-value is low and the effect size is very large (η² = .74), these metrics are unreliable and likely inflated in such a small, underpowered study. Therefore, the stability of the result is highly questionable, suggesting a low probability of successful replication.

The primary factor driving this low prediction is the extremely small sample size of four participants. Although the reported p-value is low and the effect size is very large (η² = .74), these metrics are unreliable and likely severely inflated with such a tiny sample. A finding based on N=4 is highly susceptible to idiosyncratic noise from individual subjects and is therefore unlikely to be stable enough to replicate successfully.

While the reported p-value is low (p=.005) and the effect size is extremely large (η²=.74), the sample size of only four participants is a critical weakness. Such a small sample provides very low statistical power, meaning the reported effect is likely a substantial overestimate and there is a high risk that the finding is a Type I error. Therefore, a well-powered replication is unlikely to reproduce a statistically significant result.

This prediction is low due to a combination of risk factors. The sample size is small for a three-group design, which increases the likelihood that the large reported effect size is an overestimation. Moreover, the study type—a subtle social/cognitive prime influencing diverse, high-level judgments—is a paradigm that has historically shown very low rates of successful replication. The use of the outdated `prep` statistic also places the study in an era known for methodological and statistical practices that often produced less robust findings.
---
0.25
This prediction is low due to several converging factors typical of research from an era with known replication issues. The sample size is small for a between-subjects design, meaning the study was likely underpowered to detect anything but a large effect. The reported effect size (ηp^2 = .11) is implausibly large for a subtle priming manipulation, suggesting it may be a statistical artifact or an overestimation. Finally, social-cognitive priming studies of this nature have a poor replication track record, and the use of the now-disfavored `prep` statistic is also a negative indicator.
---
0.25
This prediction is low primarily due to the small sample size (N=84), which provides insufficient statistical power and suggests the reported medium-to-large effect size is likely inflated. Furthermore, the study describes a subtle social priming effect, a research area that has historically struggled with successful replication due to the potential fragility of the phenomena. These factors weigh more heavily than the reported p-value, which, while significant, is not immune to the issues of low-powered research.
---
0.30
The study reports a strong p-value (p < .01) and a medium-to-large effect size, which are typically positive signs for replicability. However, the subfield of social-cognitive priming has a well-documented history of replication failures, and the novel priming manipulation may be highly sensitive to specific lab contexts. These factors, combined with a moderate sample size that may not yield a stable effect, substantially lower the probability of a successful replication.
---
0.25
The prediction is low due to a combination of high-risk factors. The study uses a small sample size, which increases the chance that the large reported effect size is an overestimation. Furthermore, the topic of subtle psychological priming in social cognition is a research area that has historically demonstrated low replication rates, making the novel and indirect effects reported here less likely to reproduce robustly."

The prediction is high primarily due to the extremely large test statistic (F=192.89) and very low p-value (p<.001), which indicate a massive and robust effect that should be easy to detect again. Although the sample size is only moderate for the field, the sheer magnitude of the reported effect from a controlled within-subjects experiment strongly suggests it would replicate successfully. The established author and clear theoretical framework also add to this confidence.
---
0.92
The reported F-statistic is exceptionally large, and the p-value is very small (<.001), which together imply a massive and highly significant effect size. Such strong statistical evidence suggests a robust phenomenon that is very likely to be detected again in a direct replication. While the sample size is not large, the use of a powerful within-subjects design and the sheer magnitude of the effect make this less of a concern.
---
0.32
The primary reason for this low prediction is the extremely large test statistic (F=192.89). While a low p-value is a positive indicator, an F-statistic of this magnitude implies an effect size that is almost implausibly large for this type of psychology experiment, raising concerns about potential statistical errors or artifacts. Such an extreme result is unlikely to be reproduced with a similar magnitude, even if the underlying hypothesis has some merit.
---
0.88
The prediction for high replication success is primarily driven by the extremely strong statistical evidence; the reported p-value is very low (<.001) and the F-statistic is massive, implying a very large and robust effect size. While the sample size is not large by modern standards and social-cognitive manipulations can be sensitive to context, an effect of this magnitude should be readily detectable even in a direct replication with a similar sample. The experienced first author and standard analysis type also lend modest support to a successful replication.
---
0.92
This prediction is high primarily due to the extremely large F-statistic, which implies a massive effect size and a very small p-value. While the sample size is moderate, the within-subjects design provides substantial statistical power, which combined with such a strong effect makes the finding highly likely to be robust. Although social psychology studies can have lower replication rates, the straightforward experimental manipulation and the strength of the evidence strongly suggest a successful replication."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
People are motivated to maintain social connection with others, and those who lack social connection with other humans may try to compensate by creating a sense of human connection with nonhuman agents. This may occur in at least two ways-by anthropomorphizing nonhuman agents such as nonhuman animals and gadgets to make them appear more humanlike and by increasing belief in commonly anthropomorphized religious agents (such as God). Three studies support these hypotheses both among individuals who are chronically lonely (Study 1) and among those who are induced to feel lonely (Studies 2 and 3). Additional findings suggest that such results are not simply produced by any negative affective state (Study 3). These results have important implications not only for understanding when people are likely to treat nonhuman agents as humanlike (anthropomorphism), but also for understanding when people treat human agents as nonhuman (dehumanization).

The primary concern for replication is the small sample size (N=57), which provides low statistical power for a moderately complex mixed ANOVA design. While the reported p-value is significant (p=.01) and the effect size is large (η²=.12), findings from underpowered studies are less stable and reported effect sizes are often inflated. The combination of a small sample and a p-value that is not overwhelmingly low suggests a moderate to high risk of replication failure.
---
0.35
The prediction is low primarily due to the small sample size (N=57), which provides low statistical power and can lead to unstable results. Although the p-value is significant (p=.01), it is not highly compelling, and the large reported effect size (η²=.12) is likely an overestimate that is common in underpowered studies. While the first author is well-established, these statistical weaknesses in a moderately complex design suggest a lower probability of successful replication.
---
0.35
This study's low sample size is a major risk factor for replication, as it often leads to overestimated effect sizes and less reliable p-values. Although the reported effect size is large (η² = .12), this is common in small, ""successful"" studies and may shrink considerably in a larger replication attempt. The complex statistical analysis (mixed ANOVA) also introduces potential for analytic choices that are difficult to reproduce exactly.
---
0.35
The primary concern is the very small sample size (N=57), which provides low statistical power and suggests the large reported effect size (η² = .12) may be inflated. Furthermore, the p-value of 0.01 is not sufficiently low to overcome the statistical uncertainty introduced by the small sample and moderately complex analysis. Although the first author is highly cited, these core statistical weaknesses significantly reduce the probability of a successful replication.
---
0.35
The prediction is low primarily due to the very small sample size (N=57), which increases the likelihood that the large reported effect size (η² = .12) is an overestimation and the result is unstable. While the p-value of 0.01 is significant, it is not overwhelmingly strong, and these statistical weaknesses are particularly concerning in social psychology, a subfield with historically lower replication rates. The moderately complex mixed ANOVA design further tempers confidence in a successful replication."

The prediction is very high based on the extremely large effect size (partial η² = .59) and the corresponding, highly significant test statistic (F(1, 76) = 109.74), suggesting a very robust phenomenon. The adequate sample size (N=240) further strengthens confidence that this finding is not a statistical artifact. While the novelty of the game paradigm introduces a minor risk, the sheer strength of the evidence makes replication highly probable.

The reported effect size is exceptionally large (partial η² = .59), which, combined with a very large F-statistic and an extremely low p-value, provides powerful evidence for the finding. A large sample size (N=240) for this type of lab experiment further increases confidence in the stability of the result. While the study introduces a new paradigm, the sheer magnitude of the effect suggests it is robust and highly likely to replicate successfully.

0.94
The reported statistical evidence is exceptionally strong, with a very large effect size (ηp² = .59) and a correspondingly low p-value (p ≈ 0). This effect was found in a large sample (N=240), which provides high statistical power and suggests the finding is not a fluke. The simple t‑test/ANOVA analysis is straightforward and less prone to the analytical flexibility that can reduce the replicability of more complex models.

0.95
This study has a very high probability of replication due to its exceptionally large effect size (ηp² = .59) and the conclusive statistical evidence (p ≈ 0, F = 109.74). The large sample size for a lab experiment (N=240) provides high statistical power, and the simple analysis (a t-test or one-way ANOVA) minimizes the potential for analytical error. While based on a new paradigm, the core finding aligns with robust, well-established theories of in-group favoritism, suggesting the effect is not an artifact.
---
0.92
The prediction for high replicability rests on the exceptionally strong evidence presented; the reported effect size (ηp² = .59) is massive, and the corresponding test statistic (F = 109.74) and p‑value are definitive. A respectable sample size of 240 adds to the confidence that this is a stable, non-spurious finding. While social psychology has a mixed replication history, the sheer magnitude of the effect in this straightforward experimental game makes a successful replication highly probable."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
Word-order rules impose major constraints on linguistic behavior. For example, adjectives appear before nouns in English, and after nouns in French. This means that constraints on word order must be language-specific properties upheld on-line by the language system. Despite the importance of these rules, little is known about how they operate. We report an influence of word order on the activation of phonological representations. Participants were presented with colored objects and asked to name either the colors or the objects; the phonological similarity between the object and color names was manipulated. French speakers showed a phonological congruency effect in color naming, but not in object naming. English participants yielded the opposite pattern: a phonological effect in object naming, but not in color naming. Differences in the typical order of nouns and adjectives in French and English provide a plausible account for this cross-linguistic contrast. More generally, these results provide direct evidence for the operation of word-order constraints during language production.

- Test statistic: t(14) = 3.2

Some subfields—such as social or developmental psychology—have historically shown lower replication rates compared to others like clinical or personality psychology, though individual study quality still matters.",0.35,0.35,0.35,0.4,0.35,0.36,"0.35
The prediction is low primarily due to the extremely small sample size (N=15), which suggests the finding may not be stable. This small sample likely contributed to the unusually large reported effect size (d=1.71), as such results are often inflated by sampling error and shrink substantially in higher-powered replications. While the p-value is strong, the study's key claim rests on a complex interaction pattern, which is statistically more difficult to reproduce than a simple main effect.

0.35
The primary concern is the extremely small sample size (N=15), which makes the statistical estimates highly unstable and prone to error. Consequently, the exceptionally large effect size (d=1.71) is very likely an overestimation that would shrink dramatically in a replication attempt with a larger, more appropriate sample. Although the reported p-value is low, the weak statistical power of the original study makes a successful replication unlikely.

0.35
This study’s primary weakness is its extremely small sample size (N=15), which produces unstable estimates and is a strong predictor of replication failure. While the reported p-value is low (p<.007), the massive effect size (d=1.71) is likely a substantial overestimation due to the small sample, a phenomenon known as the ""winner's curse."" A replication is therefore unlikely to find an effect of this magnitude, making the study difficult to reproduce despite its simple statistical analysis.

The primary concern is the extremely small sample size (N=15), which leads to unstable estimates and a high risk of a false positive. Although the reported p-value is low and the effect size is very large (d=1.71), such large effects found in small samples are often heavily overestimated and may not be reproducible in a replication attempt with a larger, more appropriate sample. The simple analysis type is a positive factor, but the weak evidence provided by the tiny sample size makes a successful replication less likely.
---
0.35
The primary reason for the low predicted success rate is the extremely small sample size (N=15), which provides very low statistical power and makes the results unstable. This small sample likely produced a highly inflated effect size estimate; a Cohen’s d of 1.71 is implausibly large for this type of research and would be difficult to reproduce. While the p-value is low, the finding rests on a weak statistical foundation, significantly reducing the likelihood of a successful replication."

While the sample size is respectable and the p-value is well below the .05 threshold, the probability of replication is low due to several factors. The study reports on a complex interaction within the subfield of evolutionary psychology concerning ovulatory shifts, an area known for significant replication failures. The reported effect size is also small-to-medium (f=0.19), making the finding more difficult to detect reliably and susceptible to contextual variability or methodological artifacts.

This prediction is very low primarily because the study's topic—menstrual cycle effects on mate preference—belongs to a subfield of evolutionary psychology with a poor track record of successful replication. Although the p-value is below .01, the effect size is small (f = 0.19) and the finding relies on a complex interaction, which is often less robust than a main effect. The combination of a controversial hypothesis and a small effect size makes a successful replication highly unlikely.

This prediction is low because the study tests a hypothesis from a subfield—evolutionary psychology of menstrual cycle effects—that has a very poor replication record. Although the sample size is moderate and the p-value is below .01, the finding is a complex interaction with a small-to-medium effect size (f=0.19). Such specific, smaller effects are often difficult to reproduce reliably, especially in controversial research areas.

This study investigates an ovulatory shift hypothesis, a research area notorious for poor replicability due to its complex and subtle nature. The key finding is an interaction with a small effect size (f = 0.19), which is statistically more fragile and harder to detect than a main effect. While the sample size is moderate and the p-value is significant, these factors are outweighed by the low prior odds of such a phenomenon being robust, making a successful replication unlikely.

The study's hypothesis, which links mate preference to menstrual cycle phase, belongs to a subfield of evolutionary psychology with a well-documented history of failed replications. Although the p-value is below 0.01, the small effect size (f = 0.19) suggests the finding is not very robust and would require a much larger sample to be detected reliably. The complex interaction-based finding further reduces its probable replicability."

Although the sample size is adequate and the reported p-value is below .01, the probability of replication is low. This study tests a complex interaction based on the ovulatory shift hypothesis, a theory from evolutionary psychology that has performed very poorly in large-scale, pre‑registered replication attempts. The small-to-medium effect size is also a negative indicator, as such effects are inherently less stable and require larger samples to be detected reliably.

The reported p-value of 0.008 is statistically significant, but several factors suggest a low probability of replication. The study tests a complex three-way interaction within evolutionary psychology, a subfield where ""ovulatory cycle shift"" effects have replicated poorly in larger studies. The small effect size (f = 0.19) combined with the moderate sample size (N=208) indicates the original study may have been underpowered, increasing the chance that the significant finding was due to sampling error.
---
0.22
The primary reason for the low replication probability is the study's topic; research on ovulatory cycle shifts in mate preference has a notoriously poor replication record. The reported evidence, a small-to-medium effect size (f = 0.19) from a complex three-way interaction, is not strong enough to overcome this prior skepticism. While the p-value is below .01, the moderate sample size and analysis complexity suggest the original finding could be fragile or an overestimated effect.
---
0.28
The prediction is low primarily because the study reports a small effect size (f = 0.19) for a complex interaction. More importantly, the subfield of evolutionary psychology focusing on menstrual cycle effects on mate preference has a poor record in large-scale replication studies, with many similar findings failing to replicate. While the p-value is less than .01 and the sample size is moderate, these factors are unlikely to overcome the high risk associated with a small, difficult-to-detect effect in a historically fragile research area.
---
0.20
The low probability reflects the study's topic: ovulatory shifts in mate preference, a subfield of social psychology with a history of failed replications. Although the p-value is significant (p=.008), the effect size is small (f=0.19) and the hypothesis relies on a complex interaction that is inherently difficult to reproduce reliably. The combination of a controversial theory and a small, nuanced effect makes a successful replication unlikely."

The reported p-value is very low (p≈.002 based on the F-statistic) and the effect size is exceptionally large, which points toward a strong underlying phenomenon. However, this statistical strength is undermined by the extremely small sample size (N=14), which makes the result less stable and suggests the effect size is likely overestimated. A successful replication is therefore moderately likely, as the signal appears strong enough to persist even if the true effect is smaller.
---
0.35
The primary concern for this study's replicability is the extremely small sample size of 14 participants. While the reported effect size is very large (__p^2 = 0.522) and the corresponding p-value is low (p ≈ .002), such impressive results from a small, underpowered sample are often substantially inflated due to sampling error. An independent replication, even with a larger sample, would likely find a much smaller effect that may not be statistically significant.
---
0.72
The prediction is moderately high due to a conflict between a very small sample size (N=14), a major risk factor for stability, and extremely strong statistical evidence. The very large reported effect size (ηp² = 0.522) and correspondingly low p-value (p ≈ .002, inferred from the F-statistic) suggest a robust phenomenon that is likely to be detected again. This confidence is further supported by the controlled, within-subjects experimental design common in cognitive psychology.
---
0.4
The extremely small sample size of 14 is a major concern, as it yields unstable estimates and suggests the enormous reported effect size (ηp² = .522) is likely inflated. Although the corresponding p-value is very low (p ≈ .002), this signal is derived from a statistically weak foundation. Consequently, the high risk of the original finding being a substantial overestimation reduces the likelihood of a successful replication.
---
0.35
The primary concern is the extremely small sample size (N=14), which makes the results unstable and prone to error. Although the reported p-value is very low and the effect size is massive (__p^2 = 0.522), this combination from a tiny sample is a classic red flag for the ""winner's curse,"" where the original study has likely overestimated the true effect. A replication with a more appropriately powered sample would probably find a much smaller effect, if any at all."

The very small sample size is a major concern, as it often leads to unstable results and inflated effect size estimates. While the reported effect is large (ηp² = .16), such effects found in small studies are frequently not observed in higher-powered replications. Furthermore, social priming studies of this type have a well-documented history of low replicability, making a successful independent replication highly improbable despite the original significant p-value.

The predicted probability is low due to the very small sample size (N=43) for a between‑subjects design, which makes the finding statistically fragile. This small sample reported an extremely large and likely inflated effect size (ηp² = .16) for a subtle social priming manipulation. Studies of this type, particularly in embodied cognition, have historically shown low rates of successful replication.

The study's very small sample size (N=43) provides low statistical power, making the findings susceptible to random error. This low power, combined with a surprisingly large effect size for a subtle manipulation, suggests the original result may be a statistical artifact or an overestimation. Furthermore, this type of social priming research has a poor track record in replication studies, which lowers confidence in the robustness of the effect.

0.15
The prediction is low due to the extremely small sample size (N=43), which provides low statistical power and increases the likelihood of a false positive or an inflated effect size. Furthermore, the subfield of social priming has a well-documented history of replication failures, and this type of subtle manipulation is often difficult to reproduce. While the reported effect size is large, in a small study it is likely an overestimation that would shrink or disappear in a larger, independent replication.
---
0.15
The prediction is low due to several converging risk factors. The study's sample size (N=43) is very small for a between-subjects design, which leads to low statistical power and a high risk that the significant result is a false positive. Furthermore, the reported effect size (ηp² = .16) is implausibly large for a subtle priming manipulation in social psychology, a subfield where such effects have often failed to replicate. The combination of a small sample and a surprisingly large effect suggests the original finding is not robust."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
Extremal edges (EEs) are projections of viewpoint-specific horizons of self-occlusion on smooth convex surfaces. An ecological analysis of viewpoint constraints suggests that an EE surface is likely to be closer to the observer than the non-EE surface on the other side of the edge. In two experiments, one using shading gradients and the other using texture gradients, we demonstrated that EEs operate as strong cues to relative depth perception and figure-ground organization. Image regions with an EE along the shared border were overwhelmingly perceived as closer than either flat or equally convex surfaces without an EE along that border. A further demonstration suggests that EEs are more powerful than classical figure-ground cues, including even the joint effects of small size, convexity, and surroundedness.

Although the sample size is extremely small, the reported effect size is massive (d > 1.5) with a correspondingly low p-value, suggesting a very strong and robust phenomenon. Such powerful effects in cognitive perception research, which this study represents, often replicate well despite small samples. The simple analysis and experienced author further increase confidence in the finding.

This study has a high probability of replication due to its very large effect size and highly significant p-value, which suggest a robust underlying phenomenon. While the sample size is extremely small, such a powerful effect is likely to be genuine and easily detectable, particularly within the subfield of visual perception where effects are often strong and consistent across participants. The simple statistical analysis also reduces the risk of complex, hard-to-replicate findings.

Although the sample size is extremely small (N=8), this is counteracted by an exceptionally large effect size (d=1.573) and a highly significant p-value (<.001). The simple, transparent analysis (a single-sample t-test) reduces concerns about analytical flexibility. Research in basic visual perception often uncovers robust, consistent effects, suggesting this finding is likely a genuine phenomenon that would replicate successfully.

The extremely small sample size (N=8) is a major concern, but this is offset by an exceptionally large effect size (d=1.573) and a highly significant p-value (p<.001). Such a strong signal, found using a simple analysis in a cognitive perception study—a subfield with historically higher replication rates—is very likely to replicate successfully. The high author citation count also provides a modest boost in confidence.

This study’s low probability of replication is primarily driven by the small sample size (N=53) and a p-value just meeting the significance threshold (p<.05). Such characteristics often lead to an overestimation of the true effect size, making the finding difficult to reproduce, especially given the subtle nature of the effect. The subfield of social cognition, which bridges high-level constructs and low-level processes, has also historically had mixed success with replicating these types of subtle findings.
---
0.38
The prediction is low due to the combination of a small sample size (N=53) and a modest effect size (r=-.31). A p-value reported as just under the .05 threshold indicates that the statistical evidence is not overwhelmingly strong. This profile suggests the original finding may be an overestimate (the ""winner's curse""), making it less likely to replicate successfully, especially in a study with similar statistical power.
---
0.35
The sample size of 53 provides low statistical power to reliably detect a small-to-moderate effect (r = -.31), and the imprecise reporting of p < .05 suggests the result may be fragile and only barely significant. While the correlation analysis is straightforward, the combination of a small sample and potentially overestimated effect in a subfield with mixed replication success (social/cognitive psychology) points to a lower probability of replication. The study's finding is novel, and such surprising results often have inflated effect sizes in initial reports.
---
0.28
This prediction is low primarily due to the combination of a small sample size (N=53) and a p-value just below the conventional .05 threshold. These factors indicate the original study was underpowered, increasing the likelihood that the reported effect size (r=-.31) is an overestimation and that a new, independent sample would yield a smaller, non-significant result. The finding is in social cognition, a field where conceptually abstract effects have historically shown mixed replication results.
---
0.30
The study's modest sample size (N=53) is underpowered to reliably detect the reported small-to-medium effect size (r = -.31), increasing the chance of a false positive or an overestimated effect. Furthermore, the reported p-value of <.05, rather than an exact figure, suggests the result may be only marginally significant. The topic, linking a personality trait to a subtle cognitive bias, is characteristic of social-cognitive research that has shown mixed replicability in the past."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
Action control in a changing environment requires that one shield current goals from distracting information (goal shielding) and at the same time monitor the environment for potentially significant stimuli that may afford a goal switch (background monitoring). Response conflicts modulate the balance between goal shielding and background monitoring, as indicated by reduced susceptibility to interference after response conflicts. Such conflict-adaptation effects have been attributed to enhanced recruitment of cognitive control on trials following conflicts. Here we show that conflict triggers increased goal shielding on the conflict trial itself. Subjects performed a spatial compatibility task during which they had to notice rare prospective memory cues. Such cues were overlooked more often on conflict trials than on nonconflict trials, a result indicating that shielding of the current goal and inhibition of distractors were increased on the current trial when it involved a response conflict. Thus, evidence for enhanced recruitment of control following conflict may partly reflect aftereffects of goal shielding on the conflict trial itself.

The prediction is high due to the large reported effect size (ηp^2 = .14), which suggests a robust phenomenon that is easier to detect. This confidence is supported by a p-value (p ≈ .017, calculated from the F-statistic) that is substantially lower than the typical .05 threshold and an adequate sample size for a within-subjects cognitive study. The use of a standard experimental paradigm by a highly-cited author further bolsters the likelihood of a successful replication.
---
0.82
This prediction is high due to several positive indicators, especially the large reported effect size (ηp² = .14). The study also benefits from a power‑efficient within‑subjects design, a reasonable sample size for the subfield (N=40), and a highly‑cited first author, suggesting expertise. Although the p‑value is modest (p ≈ .017, calculated from the F‑statistic), the large effect found within a standard cognitive paradigm makes the result likely to be robust.
---
0.75
This prediction is moderately high due to the large reported effect size (ηp² = .14) for a plausible cognitive mechanism, which is the strongest indicator of replicability. Although the sample size (N=40) is modest, a true effect of this magnitude should be robustly detectable in a replication attempt. Confidence is further increased by the use of a simple ANOVA and a standard, well-controlled cognitive paradigm with a within-subjects comparison.
---
0.72
This prediction is based on a combination of strong positive indicators and one point of mild concern. The very large effect size (__p^2 = .14) and the use of a standard, controlled cognitive experiment are strong predictors of success. While the sample size is modest (N=40) and the p-value (p ≈ .017, inferred from the F-statistic) is significant but not overwhelmingly so, the magnitude of the effect and the high citation count of the author suggest the finding is likely robust.
---
0.78
The study reports a large effect size (ηp^2 = .14) and a p‑value (p ≈ .017, inferred from `prep`) that is comfortably significant, suggesting a robust finding. The experimental paradigm is a standard, controlled cognitive task, which generally aids replicability. The primary concern is the relatively small sample size (N=40), which increases the chance that the reported effect size is inflated, but the effect is likely strong enough to be detected in a replication."

This study has a high likelihood of replication due to its very strong statistical evidence, including a low p-value (p<.01) and a large effect size (ηp²=.23). While the sample size (N=48) is relatively small, which could inflate the effect, the finding is theoretically plausible as it extends a well-established attentional bias from adults to children. The use of a standard experimental paradigm and straightforward analysis also supports a high probability of success.

The study reports a very large effect size (ηp² = .23) with strong statistical evidence (p < .01 from a large F-value), which are key predictors of replicability. Although the sample size is modest, the finding concerns a well-established phenomenon investigated with a standard, controlled laboratory task. These factors combine to suggest a high probability of a successful replication.

The study reports a strong signal with a p-value well below .05 and a large effect size, which are positive indicators for replication. The phenomenon itself, attentional bias to threat, is well-established in adults, and the simple ANOVA design reduces analytical flexibility. However, the small sample size (N=48) is a significant weakness that increases the risk of an overestimated effect size, tempering the overall replication likelihood.

This study has a high probability of replication due to its very strong statistical evidence, including a low p-value (p<.01) and a large effect size (ηp² = .23). While the sample size is small (N=48), which is a notable weakness, the effect is so large that it should be readily detectable in a new sample. Furthermore, the study uses a simple ANOVA on a standard visual search paradigm, a well-established method in cognitive psychology, which increases confidence in the finding's robustness.

This study reports a very large effect size (ηp² = .23) with a strong p-value (p<.01), which are primary indicators of a replicable finding. Although the sample size is relatively small, the effect is so large that the original study was well-powered to detect it, and the simple visual detection task is less subject to context effects than many social psychology paradigms. The report of three experiments in the abstract suggests the finding was robust to minor variations, increasing confidence."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
If people use the value of a class of stimuli heuristically to infer the frequency of the stimuli, they will assess more valuable stimulus classes as being less frequent even when value is not diagnostic of frequency. To test this hypothesis, we manipulated the value of stimuli only after participants had encoded them; then, participants assessed the frequencies of the stimuli. A randomization procedure ensured that stimulus value could not be diagnostic of frequency. We did not reveal these frequencies. Participants then learned that they would receive for each previously seen picture from one of the two categories (either birds or flowers). To determine the endowed category, respondents flipped a coin. Next, we asked them to estimate the number of pictures in each category. As predicted, participants were more likely to underestimate the number of flower pictures relative to bird pictures when they expected payment for flower pictures than when they expected payment for bird pictures. In contrast, they were more likely to underestimate the number of bird pictures relative to flower pictures when they expected payment for bird pictures than when they expected payment for flower pictures. Our results implicate a judgment process at the stimulus-retrieval stage, rather than at the encoding stage, because the value difference between the stimulus categories was induced randomly only after the stimuli were presented.

The prediction is low primarily due to the combination of a small sample size (N=56) and a p-value (p=0.037) that is just below the conventional threshold for significance. Such ""barely significant"" findings are often not robust and have a lower probability of replicating, as even minor sampling variations in a new study can easily yield a non-significant result. While the reported effect size is medium, it is likely an overestimation due to the small sample, a phenomenon known as the ""winner's curse.""

The prediction is low primarily due to the combination of a small sample size (N=56) and a p-value (p=0.037) that is just below the conventional significance threshold. This pattern suggests the result may be statistically fragile, and the medium effect size is likely an overestimation that would shrink in a larger, more definitive replication attempt. While the randomized design is a strength, the weakness of the statistical evidence is the overriding factor.

The prediction for lower replicability is primarily driven by the combination of a small sample size (N=56) and a p-value (p=0.037) that is just below the conventional 0.05 threshold. Such ""fragile"" results are often not robust and can be statistical artifacts, especially when the study is underpowered. While the effect size is medium and the Chi-squared analysis is straightforward, the weak statistical evidence suggests a replication is more likely than not to fail.
---
0.35
The low probability is driven primarily by the p-value of 0.037, which is only barely below the conventional significance threshold and is a strong negative predictor of replicability. This weak evidence is compounded by the small sample size (N=56), which suggests the medium-sized effect may be an overestimate due to sampling error. While the study design is straightforward, these statistical weaknesses present a substantial challenge for a successful replication.

0.22
The prediction is low due to several converging risk factors for non-replication. The sample size (N=56) is small, and the p‑value (p=0.037) is just below the conventional significance threshold, a combination that suggests the result may not be robust and the reported medium effect size is likely overestimated. Additionally, the study is in social psychology, a subfield that has historically faced challenges with replicability, especially for novel and counter‑intuitive findings like this one."

The extremely small sample size (N=18) is a major concern, as it can lead to unstable results and inflated effect sizes. The reported effect size (η² = .7) is implausibly large for this type of cognitive paradigm, suggesting the original finding was likely an overestimation due to sampling error. Despite the reported statistical significance, the combination of a tiny sample and a huge effect makes a successful replication improbable.

0.35
The prediction for a low probability of successful replication is driven by the combination of an extremely small sample size (N=18) and a massive, likely inflated, effect size (η²=.7). While the reported p-value is strong (p≈.007), findings from such small, underpowered studies are often noisy, and the estimated effect size is unlikely to be so large in a higher-powered replication attempt. The subfield of embodied cognition has also had mixed results in large-scale replication projects, adding to the uncertainty.
---
0.35
The primary concerns are the very small sample size (N=18) and the implausibly large effect size (η²=.7), which is also inconsistent with the reported F-statistic. Such small, underpowered studies often produce inflated effect size estimates, meaning an independent replication is likely to find a smaller, non-significant effect. While the resulting p-value is low, this is less reassuring given the instability of estimates from such a small sample.

While the reported p-value and extremely large effect size appear strong, the very small sample size (N=18) is a major weakness that makes the estimates unstable and likely inflated. Although the finding was internally replicated, underpowered studies with massive reported effects often fail to replicate or show a substantially smaller effect in higher-powered replications. The subfield of embodied cognition has also had a mixed record of replication success.
---
0.35
The primary concern is the extremely small sample size (N=18), which makes the findings susceptible to chance and statistical noise. This small sample likely produced the implausibly large effect size (η² = .7), a classic sign of effect size inflation that is unlikely to be reproduced in a larger, more robust study. Although the p-value is strong, results from such underpowered designs frequently fail to replicate or show a dramatically smaller effect upon replication."
