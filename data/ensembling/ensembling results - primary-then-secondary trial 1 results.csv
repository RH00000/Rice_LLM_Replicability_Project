Note:
First consider the subfield—some areas (e.g., social or developmental psychology) have historically shown lower replication rates—then adjust that judgment based on the specific study’s sample size, p-value, effect size, method complexity, and author citation count.",0.45,0.35,0.35,0.42,0.58,0.43,"0.45
The probability is below 50% due to the very low effective sample size (N≈14, as implied by the ANOVA's degrees of freedom) and a p-value of 0.02, which is close to the significance threshold. Although the reported effect size is large and the author is highly cited in cognitive psychology, such a small sample provides weak statistical evidence and suggests the effect size may be highly inflated. This combination of factors makes the specific finding vulnerable in an independent replication attempt.
---
0.35
The reported p-value of 0.02 offers only weak evidence, and findings in this range often fail to replicate. This concern is amplified by a critical inconsistency between the stated sample size (N=24) and the F-test’s degrees of freedom (df=13), which suggests low power or questionable analytic choices that undermine the result's credibility. Although the effect size is large, it is likely inflated and may not be reproducible in a higher-powered replication attempt.
---
0.35
The primary concern is the extremely low statistical power, evidenced by the small sample size and especially the very low error degrees of freedom (df=13) for the reported F‑test. While the reported partial eta‑squared is large, such large effects in small samples are often inflated, and the p‑value of 0.02 is close to the significance threshold, suggesting the result may not be robust. Although the study comes from a highly‑cited author in cognitive psychology, the weak statistical evidence for this specific finding makes a successful replication unlikely.
---
0.42
While the author's high citation count and the large reported effect size are positive indicators, the study's statistical foundation is weak. The effective sample size is very small (N≈14, inferred from the degrees of freedom), and the p-value is close to the significance threshold (p=0.02). This combination suggests a high risk that the original finding is a false positive or that the effect size is substantially inflated, reducing the likelihood of a successful replication.
---
0.58
The prediction is moderately positive, primarily driven by the very large reported effect size (ηp^2 = 0.354) within a standard cognitive psychology paradigm by a well-cited author. However, confidence is significantly tempered by the small sample size, a p‑value (0.02) that is just below the conventional significance threshold, and unusually low error degrees of freedom, which indicate potential statistical fragility."

The probability is high despite the small sample size (N=24). The extremely large reported effect size (ηp² = .374) and low p-value (<.005) suggest a robust phenomenon that is likely to replicate. Furthermore, the study investigates a well-established effect (repetition blindness) within cognitive psychology using a standard within-subjects design, which enhances its plausibility.
---
0.68
The very low reported p-value (<0.005) and large effect size (ηp² = .374) suggest a robust finding. However, this conclusion is tempered by the very small sample size of 24 participants, which makes the result more susceptible to sampling error and the large effect size likely to be an overestimation. The study’s grounding in cognitive psychology and its use of a powerful within-subjects design provide some countervailing confidence in the result.
---
0.82
The very low p‑value and extremely large effect size suggest a robust finding likely to replicate. While the sample size is small, this is somewhat mitigated by the within‑subjects design (RM ANOVA) common in cognitive psychology, where such powerful effects are often found in controlled lab experiments. The systematic series of experiments described in the abstract also lends credibility to the overall conclusion.
---
0.82
While the small sample size (N=24) is a significant concern, several factors strongly favor successful replication. The reported p-value is very low (<.005) and the effect size is extremely large (ηp² = .374), suggesting a powerful and reliable effect typical of robust cognitive phenomena. Moreover, the study is not a one-off finding but part of a programmatic series of six experiments designed to isolate a mechanism, which implies a high degree of methodological care and a deeper understanding of the effect's boundary conditions.
---
0.62
The study reports a strong p-value (<.005) and a very large effect size (ηp² = .374) in a within-subjects design, which are strong positive indicators for replication. However, this is counterbalanced by a very small sample size (N=24), which can produce inflated and unstable effect estimates. Furthermore, the abstract describes an effect that is highly sensitive to participant strategy and subtle experimental manipulations, which can make successful replication difficult to achieve."

Note:
First consider the subfield—some areas (e.g., social or developmental psychology) have historically shown lower replication rates—then adjust that judgment based on the specific study’s sample size, p-value, effect size, method complexity, and author citation count.",0.72,0.42,0.32,0.32,0.45,0.446,"0.72
Although the sample size is small and the p-value is only just below the 0.05 significance threshold, several factors support replicability. The large effect size and likely within-subjects design are positive signs, but the most crucial detail is that the finding was demonstrated across a series of four experiments. This internal replication within the original paper provides strong evidence for the robustness of the effect, outweighing the weaknesses of any single statistical test.
---
0.42
The reported p-value is just under the 0.05 threshold, which is the strongest indicator of a potentially lower replication likelihood. This concern is heightened by the small sample size (N=25), a combination that often leads to inflated effect size estimates. Although the reported partial eta-squared is large and the within-subjects design increases statistical power, the weakness of the original statistical evidence makes a successful replication less certain.
---
0.32
This prediction is low due to the combination of a small sample size (N=25) and a p-value (p≈0.03) that is only narrowly significant, suggesting the study was underpowered. The large reported effect size is therefore likely inflated, and this specific finding has a high chance of being a false positive or an overestimation. While the finding is part of a larger series of experiments, the core statistical evidence presented here is weak and the use of a complex MANOVA can further obscure replicability.
---
0.32
The primary factors driving this low prediction are the small sample size (N=25) and a p‑value (p≈0.03) that is just below the threshold for significance. This combination suggests the result is fragile and the large reported effect size is likely an overestimation due to sampling error (i.e., the ""winner's curse""). While the first author's high citation count and the controlled cognitive paradigm are positive indicators, they are outweighed by the weak statistical evidence for the key finding.
---
0.45
This prediction is below 0.5 primarily due to the small sample size (N=25) and a p-value that is significant but worryingly close to the .05 threshold (an F‑statistic of 5.29 yields p≈0.03), which indicates the result may be statistically fragile. While the controlled cognitive experiment and the large reported effect size are positive signals, the former factors strongly suggest the finding may be difficult to replicate. The probability is not lower because the abstract reports a series of four experiments, suggesting a degree of internal replication that increases confidence in the underlying phenomenon."

The reported study has a high probability of successful replication due to its large sample size (N=240) and a very low p-value (p<0.001), which together suggest a statistically robust finding. While the effect size is small-to-medium (ηp² = 0.052), meaning a replication would also require high statistical power, the use of a standard analysis within a well-controlled cognitive paradigm strengthens confidence in the result. The finding's ""surprising"" nature is the primary risk, but the strong evidence outweighs this concern.

The reported p-value is very low (<0.001) and supported by a large sample size (N=240), both of which are strong positive predictors of replicability. While the effect size is small-to-medium (ηp² = 0.052), the study's high statistical power lends confidence to the result. The use of a standard analysis and a paradigm from cognitive psychology, a field with relatively high replication rates, further bolsters the prediction of a successful replication.
---
0.85
The probability of replication is very high, primarily due to the large sample size (N=240) and the very low p‑value (p<0.001), which suggest a robust finding. While the mixed ANOVA is a complex analysis and the effect size is small-to-medium (ηp² = 0.052), the study's high statistical power provides strong confidence that the effect is genuine. The finding comes from cognitive psychology, a subfield with a good track record for replicability.
---
0.72
This study has a high likelihood of replication due to its large sample size (N=240) and highly significant p‑value (p<0.001), which suggest a robustly detected effect. However, the probability is tempered because the reported effect size is only small‑to‑medium (ηp²=0.052), and the abstract describes the finding as ""very surprising,"" a characteristic often associated with less replicable results. The first author's solid citation count provides a modest counterweight, suggesting methodological rigor.
---
0.83
This study has a high probability of replication due to its strong statistical evidence, including a large sample size for the field and a very low p‑value. Although the effect size is small‑to‑medium and the main finding is a potentially less-robust interaction effect, the high statistical power and use of a standard cognitive paradigm suggest the result is reliable. The cognitive subfield generally has a better track record for replication than some other areas of psychology."

A robust finding in humans and animals is that intermixed exposure to 2 similar stimuli (AX/BX) results in better discriminability of those stimuli on test than does exposure to 2 equally similar stimuli in 2 separate blocks (CX_DX)--the intermixed-blocked effect. This intermixed-blocked effect may be an example of the superiority of spaced over massed practice; in the intermixed, but not the blocked exposure regime, each presentation of a given stimulus (e.g., AX) is separated from the next by the presentation of its partner (BX). Two experiments with human participants replicated the intermixed-blocked effect and showed that the effect was not due to the spacing of exposure trials. A mechanism for the intermixed-blocked effect is proposed, which combines theories from associative learning and memory.

Key details:
- Sample size: 32
- Analysis type (e.g. rm ANOVA, mixed ANOVA, regression, t‑test): RM ANOVA
- Test statistic: F(1,31) = 8.38

Note:
First consider the subfield—some areas (e.g., social or developmental psychology) have historically shown lower replication rates—then adjust that judgment based on the specific study’s sample size, p-value, effect size, method complexity, and author citation count.",0.72,0.78,0.68,0.82,0.88,0.776,"0.72
The probability of replication is moderately high, primarily driven by the strong p-value (p≈.007, calculated from the F-statistic) and a solid, medium-sized effect (dz=0.51). The study's within-subjects design is powerful and appropriate for the question, and investigating a phenomenon described as ""robust"" adds to this confidence. The main negative factor is the small sample size (N=32), which introduces uncertainty and risks an overestimation of the true effect size.
---
0.78
The test statistic F(1,31) = 8.38 yields a p-value of approximately 0.007, which is highly significant and strongly suggests a replicable finding. This confidence is bolstered by the medium effect size (dz = 0.51) and the use of a standard, controlled cognitive psychology paradigm. The primary source of uncertainty is the small sample size (N=32), which slightly increases the risk that the observed effect is an overestimation.
---
0.68
The prediction is moderately high due to several positive indicators, including a strong p-value (p ≈ .007, calculated from the F-statistic) and a medium effect size within a powerful repeated-measures design. However, this confidence is tempered by the small sample size (N=32), which increases the risk of an overestimated effect and makes the finding susceptible to sampling error. The study's foundation in cognitive psychology on a reportedly ""robust"" phenomenon provides a slight boost to its likely replicability.
---
0.82
The first author's high citation count suggests expertise, and the statistical evidence is strong, with a p-value well below .01 (inferred from the F-statistic) and a medium effect size. This study also replicates a ""robust finding"" from cognitive psychology using a powerful within-subjects design. The only notable weakness is the small sample size, but the strength of the other factors makes a successful replication highly probable.
---
0.88
This study has a high likelihood of replication due to strong statistical evidence and a robust design. The reported F-statistic corresponds to a very low p-value (p ≈ .007), which, combined with a medium effect size (dz = 0.51) and an adequately-powered within-subjects sample, suggests a reliable finding. The abstract further boosts confidence by stating the core phenomenon is a ""robust finding,"" implying it has been successfully replicated before."

The reported p-value is very low (0.002) and the effect size is large (d=0.72), both of which are strong positive indicators for replicability. However, the small sample size (N=24) is a significant concern, as it can lead to inflated and unstable effect size estimates. The simple analysis (t-test) and focus on established cognitive phenomena provide some additional confidence, leading to a moderately high probability of replication.

0.65
The very low p‑value (p = .002) and medium‑to‑large effect size (dz = 0.724) provide strong evidence for the specific statistical comparison, suggesting a higher likelihood of replication. However, this is significantly tempered by the small sample size (N = 24), which increases the risk that the effect is overestimated. The study’s primary method is computational modeling, which is inherently complex and can be difficult for an independent lab to reproduce precisely, lowering the overall confidence in a successful replication.
---
0.7
The reported p-value is low (p=0.002) and the analysis is a simple dependent t-test, which reduces concerns about analytic flexibility. However, the sample size is very small (N=24), which suggests the large reported effect size (dz=0.724) may be inflated. Nevertheless, the study is in cognitive psychology, where within-subjects effects like priming can be robust, making a successful replication reasonably likely despite the small original sample.
---
0.72
The prediction is fairly high primarily due to the strong p-value (0.002) and a medium-to-large effect size (dz=0.724), both of which are strong indicators of replicability. However, this optimism is tempered by the very small sample size (N=24), which introduces uncertainty and suggests the reported effect could be overestimated. The low author citation count is a minor negative factor, while the simple statistical analysis is a minor positive one.
---
0.68
This study’s prospects for replication are driven by a tension between strong statistical evidence and a weak sample. The very low p‑value (0.002) and large effect size (dz = 0.724) are strong positive indicators, as is the simple, standard analysis. However, the very small sample size (N=24) is a major weakness that increases the risk that the effect size is an overestimation and may not be stable in a larger, independent sample."

The prediction is very high due to an extremely large effect size (d = 1.02) and a correspondingly high test statistic (t = 10.18), indicating a very robust finding. This strong evidence is supported by a decent sample size (N=100) and a simple analysis (dependent t-test), which reduces the likelihood of complex errors. Furthermore, the study models well-established phenomena in cognitive psychology, a field known for robust effects, increasing the chances of a successful replication.
---
0.94
The reported test statistic (t=10.18) implies a p-value that is vastly smaller than the reported p<0.05, providing extremely strong evidence against the null hypothesis. This conclusion is bolstered by a very large effect size (d=1.02) and an adequate sample size for a within-subjects design (N=100). The simplicity of the analysis (a dependent t-test) and the study's focus on a fundamental cognitive phenomenon also suggest a high likelihood of successful replication.
---
0.94
This study has a very high probability of replication due to its extremely large effect size (d = 1.02) and a t-statistic that implies a highly significant p-value, despite the coarse reporting. The statistical analysis is a simple t-test with low analytic flexibility, and the sample size of 100 is solid for this design. Furthermore, as a computational modeling study of robust, well-established cognitive phenomena, it is less susceptible to the sources of noise that can lower replicability in novel empirical research.

The first author’s high citation count suggests considerable experience, which is a positive indicator. The prediction is primarily driven by an exceptionally large effect size (d = 1.02) and a very low p-value (inferred from the t-statistic), which, combined with a solid sample size and a simple analysis, makes a successful replication highly probable. Additionally, the study investigates core cognitive psychology phenomena, a subfield with a strong track record of replicable findings.

The prediction is high due to the exceptionally large effect size (d = 1.02) and highly significant test statistic, which suggest a robust finding. This conclusion is supported by an adequate sample size (N=100) for a simple dependent t-test. Furthermore, the study investigates a classic phenomenon in cognitive psychology, a field with historically strong replication for such core effects."

First consider the subfield—some areas (e.g., social or developmental psychology) have historically shown lower replication rates—then adjust that judgment based on the specific study’s sample size, p-value, effect size, method complexity, and author citation count.",0.88,0.92,0.92,0.82,0.85,0.878,"0.88
Although the sample size of 39 is a concern and suggests the large effect size may be inflated, the finding is highly likely to replicate. This confidence stems from the very low p-value (<.001), the large magnitude of the effect (__p^2 = .32), and especially the fact that the authors demonstrated the result across three internal experiments. The phenomenon, a stereotype-driven memory error, is also a classic and robust finding within cognitive and social psychology.
---
0.92
The reported p-value is very low (p<.001) and the effect size is very large (ηp²=.32), both of which are strong positive indicators for replicability. Although the sample size (N=39) is small, detecting such a strong effect with a modest sample suggests the underlying phenomenon is very robust. The finding is also a classic demonstration of stereotype-driven memory errors, a well-established concept in cognitive and social psychology.

0.92
This study has a very high probability of replication due to its extremely strong evidence: a very low p-value (<.001) and a very large effect size (ηp² = .32). Although the sample size (N=39) is small, the sheer magnitude of the effect suggests it is robust and should be easily detectable even in a direct replication. The use of a standard ANOVA is straightforward, and the finding itself—stereotype-driven memory bias—is a classic, well-established phenomenon in cognitive and social psychology.
---
0.82
This study has a high probability of replication, primarily driven by a very strong p‑value (p<.001) and a large reported effect size (ηp²=.32). Although the small sample size (N=39) is a significant concern that could indicate an overestimated effect, this risk is offset by the sheer magnitude of the statistics, the experienced author, and the standard ANOVA methodology applied to a classic cognitive phenomenon.
---
0.85
The prediction is high due to the exceptionally strong statistical evidence; the very low p-value (<.001) and large effect size (ηp² = .32) are powerful indicators of a robust finding. Although the subfield of social psychology and the modest sample size (N=39) introduce some caution, the sheer magnitude of the reported effect suggests it is highly likely to be detected again in a replication attempt. The straightforward experimental design and internal replication across three experiments further boost confidence."

This study has a high probability of replication due to its extremely low p‑value (<.001) and very large effect size (ηp² = 0.488). While the sample size is small, the study's use of a powerful within-subjects design in cognitive psychology to test a well-established type of effect adds to this confidence. The sheer strength of the reported statistical evidence suggests the finding is robust and would likely be found again.

This study has a very high probability of successful replication due to its extremely strong statistical evidence, including a p-value < .001 and a massive effect size (ηp² = 0.488). While the sample size is relatively small, the effect is so large that the study was likely well-powered, and the finding is based on standard, controlled cognitive paradigms that tend to replicate well. The combination of a highly significant p-value and a large effect are the strongest predictors of replicability."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
The authors investigated semantic neighborhood density effects on visual word processing to examine the dynamics of activation and competition among semantic representations. Experiment 1 validated feature-based semantic representations as a basis for computing semantic neighborhood density and suggested that near and distant neighbors have opposite effects on word processing. Experiment 2 confirmed these results: Word processing was slower for dense near neighborhoods and faster for dense distant neighborhoods. Analysis of a computational model showed that attractor dynamics can produce this pattern of neighborhood effects. The authors argue for reconsideration of traditional models of neighborhood effects in terms of attractor dynamics, which allow both inhibitory and facilitative effects to emerge.

The primary risk to replication is the very small sample size (N=22), which suggests the extremely large effect size is likely inflated due to the ""winner's curse."" However, this concern is balanced by the highly significant p-value (<.001) and large F-statistic, which are strong positive predictors of replicability. The use of a powerful within-subjects design (RM ANOVA) in a controlled cognitive experiment also increases confidence that a real effect exists and would be detected again.
---
0.72
The extremely low p-value (p < .001) and very large effect size (ηp² = .452) are strong positive predictors of replicability. However, confidence is significantly tempered by the very small sample size (N=22), which makes the result susceptible to sampling error and suggests the reported effect size is likely inflated. The strength of the statistical signal in a standard cognitive paradigm probably outweighs the methodological weakness, leading to a moderately high prediction.
---
0.65
The extremely low p-value (p<.001) and very large effect size (ηp²=.452) suggest a robust phenomenon that is likely to replicate. However, the very small sample size (N=22) introduces significant risk, as results from small samples are often inflated and less stable. The final estimate balances the strong statistical signal against the weak sample foundation, with the standard analysis and established author providing minor additional confidence.
---
0.45
Although the reported p-value (<.001) and extremely large effect size (ηp² = .452) suggest a robust finding, these statistics are highly likely to be inflated due to the very small sample size (N=22). Small samples can produce overestimated results, which is a primary risk factor for replication failure, even with an experienced author. While the within-subjects design is powerful, the complexity of the interaction effect further tempers confidence in a successful replication.
---
0.75
The reported p-value is very low (<.001) and the effect size is extremely large (ηp² = .452), both of which strongly predict a successful replication. While the sample size (N=22) is small, which introduces risk, the sheer magnitude of the reported effect suggests it is robust. The study’s grounding in cognitive psychology, a field with a comparatively better replication history, further bolsters this prediction."

The probability is low primarily due to the combination of a small sample size (N=48) and a ""just-significant"" p-value, as indicated by an F‑statistic that is very close to the critical threshold for p<.05. While the reported effect size (d=.52) is medium, this is likely an overestimation common in underpowered studies. Furthermore, the finding is a specific interaction effect from a mixed ANOVA, which can be less robust and harder to replicate than a simpler main effect.

0.35
The prediction is low primarily due to the reported p-value being just under the .05 threshold, which is a strong predictor of replication failure. While the reported effect size is medium (d = .52), the relatively small sample size for a mixed ANOVA design suggests this effect may be overestimated. The specific finding of an interaction effect can also be more difficult to replicate than a simple main effect.
---
0.32
The prediction for low replicability is primarily driven by the p-value being just under the .05 significance threshold, a known risk factor for non-replication. This concern is amplified by the small sample size (N=48) for a complex mixed ANOVA design, which reduces statistical power and can lead to inflated effect size estimates. While the effect size is medium, the combination of a small sample and a borderline p-value suggests the finding may not be robust.
---
0.40
The reported p-value is extremely close to the .05 threshold, and the sample size is small, both of which are strong negative predictors of replicability. While the reported medium effect size and the author's experience are positive signs, the weak statistical evidence suggests the result is fragile and may be an overestimation due to low statistical power. The complexity of the mixed ANOVA design also adds a minor element of risk to precise replication.
---
0.32
The primary reason for this low prediction is the p-value being very close to the .05 significance threshold, which is a strong indicator of a fragile result. This concern is amplified by the small sample size for a mixed ANOVA, increasing the chances that this is a false positive or that the reported effect size is inflated. While the study is in cognitive psychology, which tends to be more robust, these specific statistical weaknesses suggest the finding is unlikely to replicate."

In Experiment 3, participants practiced both multiplication and factoring and presented facilitative transfer in both directions. Thus, bidirectional facilitation occurred if both operations were practiced, but interference occurred when only one operation was practiced. We propose that this seemingly paradoxical behavior occurs because it is adaptive for the bidirectional retrieval structure to retain operational flexibility in the context of practicing both operations, whereas it is adaptive to specialize the memory representation for the practiced operation (i.e., factoring or multiplication) when only one operation is practiced.

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
A variety of experimental evidence indicates that the memory representation for multiplication facts (e.g., 6 x 9 = 54) incorporates bidirectional links with a forward association from factors to product and a reverse association from product to factors. Surprisingly, the authors did not find evidence in Experiment 1 of facilitative transfer-of-practice from multiplication (6 x 9 = ?) to factoring (54 = ? x ?); in fact, multiplication practice produced item-specific interference with factoring. Similarly, the authors found no evidence in Experiment 2 that repetition of specific factoring problems (54 = ? x ?) facilitated performance of corresponding multiplication problems (6 x 9 = ?). In Experiment 3, participants practiced both multiplication and factoring and presented facilitative transfer in both directions. Thus, bidirectional facilitation occurred if both operations were practiced, but interference occurred when only one operation was practiced.

Note:
First consider the subfield—some areas (e.g., social or developmental psychology) have historically shown lower replication rates—then adjust that judgment based on the specific study’s sample size, p-value, effect size, method complexity, and author citation count.",0.85,0.88,0.88,0.85,0.85,0.862,"0.85
Despite the small sample size, which is a significant risk factor, the reported statistical evidence is exceptionally strong, featuring a very low p‑value (<.001) and a massive effect size (ηp² = 0.55). Such a powerful signal is highly likely to be robust and detectable in a direct replication, even one with a similarly modest sample. Confidence is further increased by the high citation count of the first author and the study's foundation in cognitive psychology, which tends to have more replicable findings.
---
0.88
The prediction is high due to the extremely strong evidence reported: a very low p-value (p < .001) and a massive effect size (ηp² = 0.550). While the sample size of 36 is small, an effect of this magnitude should be robust and easily detectable in a direct replication. The finding, which involves an interaction in a standard cognitive paradigm, is also from an experienced author, further increasing confidence.
---
0.88
While the small sample size (N=36) and complex mixed-ANOVA design present some risk, this is strongly offset by the reported statistical evidence. The exceptionally large effect size (partial η² = 0.55) and very low p-value (p < .001) indicate a powerful and robust phenomenon typical of core cognitive research. Even accounting for potential ""winner's curse"" inflation, an effect of this magnitude is highly likely to be detected in a direct replication.
---
0.85
This prediction is high due to the exceptionally strong evidence for the effect, despite some methodological concerns. The p-value is very low (<.001) and the effect size is massive (ηp² = 0.550), suggesting a powerful and easily detectable phenomenon, which outweighs the risk posed by the small sample size (N=36). The first author's high citation count and the study's basis in cognitive psychology, a field with relatively higher replication rates, further increase the likelihood of a successful replication.
---
0.85
This prediction is high due to the extremely strong statistical evidence, including a very low p-value (< .001) and a very large effect size (ηp² = .55). While the small sample size of 36 is a significant concern and may have inflated the effect size estimate, the sheer magnitude of the reported effect suggests a robust underlying phenomenon. The study's focus within cognitive psychology, a subfield with a relatively good replication history, further supports a successful replication."

First consider the subfield—some areas (e.g., social or developmental psychology) have historically shown lower replication rates—then adjust that judgment based on the specific study’s sample size, p-value, effect size, method complexity, and author citation count.",0.4,0.25,0.3,0.35,0.35,0.33,"0.40
The probability is relatively low due to the combination of a very small effect size (d = 0.198) and a p‑value (p = 0.028) that is just below the standard significance threshold. While the sample size (N = 95) is decent and the cognitive paradigm is well‑established, such weak statistical evidence makes the finding fragile and susceptible to non‑replication. A replication study would require high statistical power to reliably detect such a small effect.
---
0.25
The reported p-value of 0.028 is very close to the conventional significance threshold of .05, which indicates weak evidence against the null hypothesis. This p-value is also likely from a one-tailed test, as the corresponding two-tailed p-value for the given t-statistic is p=0.056; this use of a one-tailed test further weakens confidence in the result. Combined with a small effect size (d=0.198), the finding is unlikely to be robust, making a successful replication improbable despite the adequate sample size and simple analysis.
---
0.30
The reported p-value of 0.028 is just below the conventional significance threshold, and the corresponding effect size (d = 0.198) is small, a combination that strongly predicts replication failure. While the simple dependent t-test analysis is a positive sign, the weak statistical evidence suggests the original finding may be a type I error or a substantial overestimation of a tiny true effect. The moderate sample size is insufficient to lend high confidence to such a fragile result.
---
0.35
The replication probability is low due to the combination of a small effect size (d=0.198) and a p-value (p=0.028) that is just below the conventional threshold for significance. These factors suggest the finding is statistically fragile and at high risk of being a false positive or an overestimation. While the sample size is adequate for a within-subjects design and the analysis is simple, these strengths are not enough to overcome the weakness of the statistical evidence.
---
0.35
This prediction is low primarily due to the combination of a small effect size (d = 0.198) and a p-value (p = 0.028) that is very close to the conventional 0.05 threshold for statistical significance. Such a ""fragile"" p-value for a small effect suggests that the finding may not be robust and could easily fail to replicate due to normal sampling variability. While the study is in the relatively high-replicability subfield of cognitive psychology and uses a simple analysis, the weak statistical evidence is the most critical factor."

While the sample size of 39 is small, which is a significant risk factor, this is offset by several strong positive indicators. The extremely low p‑value (<.001) and large effect size (ηp² = 0.186) suggest a robust finding that is unlikely to be a statistical fluke. The use of a repeated‑measures ANOVA implies a powerful within‑subjects design, which, combined with the experienced author and cognitive psychology context, increases the probability of replication success.

0.65
The prediction is primarily driven by the strong reported evidence: an extremely low p-value (p < .001) and a large effect size (ηp² = 0.186). However, this confidence is substantially tempered by the very small sample size (N=39), which is a major concern as it can produce unstable and inflated effect estimates. The standard analysis method (RM ANOVA) and experienced author are minor positive factors, but the small sample remains the primary source of risk.

0.78
The reported p-value is very low (<.001) and the effect size is large (ηp² = 0.186), which are strong indicators of a robust and replicable finding. While the sample size (N=39) is a notable concern, this is partly offset by the statistical power of the repeated-measures ANOVA design and the fact that the abstract mentions two successful experiments, suggesting internal replication. The strength of the statistical evidence likely outweighs the risk from the small sample.
---
0.75
The prediction is high due to multiple strong signals for replicability, including a highly cited first author, a very low p-value (p<.001), and a large effect size (ηp²=0.186). While the sample size of 39 is small, the study's use of a powerful repeated-measures ANOVA design partially mitigates this concern. The combination of a strong, precisely estimated effect from an experienced author suggests a high probability of successful replication.
---
0.78
This study has a high probability of replicating due to its very low p‑value (<.001) and large effect size (ηp² = 0.186), which suggest a robust phenomenon. The main weakness is the small sample size of 39, which increases the risk that the true effect is smaller than what was observed. However, the strength of the statistical evidence is compelling and suggests a replication would likely succeed, despite its grounding in social psychology, a subfield with a mixed replication history."

This study has a high probability of replication primarily due to its very low p‑value (<.001) and extremely large effect size (ηp² = .31), which suggest a highly robust finding. Although the sample size (N=32) is small, the strength of the reported signal is so great that it should be easily detectable in a new sample. The analysis method is standard for the cognitive subfield, and the high author citation count suggests a level of expertise that slightly increases confidence.

This prediction is high due to multiple strong signals, including a highly experienced author, a very low p-value (<.001), and a very large effect size (ηp² = .31). While the small sample size (N=32) raises concerns about potential effect size inflation, the reported effect is so large that a genuine, replicable phenomenon is still highly probable. Furthermore, controlled cognitive psychology experiments on memory tend to have higher replication rates.

0.92
The prediction is high due to the combination of a very strong p-value (p<.001) and a large effect size (ηp² = .31), both of which are key predictors of replicability. This confidence is bolstered by the study's nature as a classic cognitive psychology experiment, a field with relatively high replication rates, and the use of a within-subjects design for which the sample size is adequate. The high citation count of the first author further suggests a well-established and methodologically rigorous research program."

The sample size of 96 is adequate for this type of study, which is a positive sign. However, the primary finding has a p-value that is close to the .05 significance threshold and a small effect size (ηp²=.05). Findings with weaker statistical evidence are less likely to replicate successfully, and the complexity of a mixed ANOVA interaction effect further reduces confidence.
---
0.62
The reported p-value of <.05 is the most significant concern, as findings that are 'just significant' often fail to replicate. This risk is compounded by a small-to-medium effect size (ηp² = .05) and a relatively complex mixed ANOVA design testing an interaction. However, these negative factors are partly offset by a respectable sample size for a controlled cognitive psychology experiment, a subfield with a comparatively better replication record.
---
0.45
The reported p-value is close to the .05 significance threshold and the effect size is small-to-medium, which are indicators of lower replicability. Furthermore, the key finding is an interaction from a mixed ANOVA, which is a complex result that can be more difficult to reproduce than a simple main effect. While the sample size is reasonable for a cognitive study, the statistical evidence for the effect is not overwhelmingly strong.
---
0.35
The author's citation count and the adequate sample size are positive indicators, but they are outweighed by several risk factors. The primary concern is the combination of a p‑value that is close to the significance threshold (the F‑statistic corresponds to p≈.028) and a small-to-medium effect size (η²=.05). Furthermore, the key finding is a specific interaction effect that only emerged in the third of three experiments, which suggests the phenomenon might be fragile and difficult to reproduce consistently.
---
0.41
This prediction is below 50% primarily due to the weak statistical evidence for the main finding. A p-value just under the .05 threshold (F(1,94) = 4.97 corresponds to p≈.028) and a small-to-medium effect size (η²=.05) indicate that the result is not statistically robust. Although the sample size is adequate and the study is theory-driven in cognitive psychology, these positive factors are outweighed by the high probability that the original finding was a p-hacked result or was simply not powered well enough to be reliable."

The authors evaluated several possible versions of the inhibition hypothesis by comparing monolinguals and bilinguals with regard to stop signal performance, inhibition of return, and the attentional blink. These three phenomena, it can be argued, tap into different aspects of inhibition. Monolinguals and bilinguals did not differ in stop signal reaction time and thus were comparable in terms of active-inhibitory efficiency. However, bilinguals showed no facilitation from spatial cues, showed a strong inhibition of return effect, and exhibited a more pronounced attentional blink. These results suggest that bilinguals do not differ from monolinguals in terms of active inhibition but have acquired a better ability to maintain action goals and to use them to bias goal-related information. Under some circumstances, this ability may indirectly lead to more pronounced reactive inhibition of irrelevant information.","Cognitive, Social",0,"# System

The authors evaluated several possible versions of the inhibition hypothesis by comparing monolinguals and bilinguals with regard to stop signal performance, inhibition of return, and the attentional blink. These three phenomena, it can be argued, tap into different aspects of inhibition. Monolinguals and bilinguals did not differ in stop signal reaction time and thus were comparable in terms of active-inhibitory efficiency. However, bilinguals showed no facilitation from spatial cues, showed a strong inhibition of return effect, and exhibited a more pronounced attentional blink. These results suggest that bilinguals do not differ from monolinguals in terms of active inhibition but have acquired a better ability to maintain action goals and to use them to bias goal-related information. Under some circumstances, this ability may indirectly lead to more pronounced reactive inhibition of irrelevant information.

Key details:

Note:
First consider the subfield—some areas (e.g., social or developmental psychology) have historically shown lower replication rates—then adjust that judgment based on the specific study’s sample size, p-value, effect size, method complexity, and author citation count.",0.25,0.25,0.15,0.22,0.22,0.218,"0.25
The primary concern is the extremely small sample size (N=18), which provides low statistical power and produces unstable estimates that are less likely to replicate. Although the p-value is low (p=0.002), achieving such significance with a tiny sample often signals a potentially inflated effect size that is difficult to reproduce. The controversial nature of the bilingual advantage literature, combined with the complex pattern of results, further decreases the likelihood of a successful replication.
---
0.25
The reported p-value is very low (0.002), which would normally suggest a high likelihood of replication. However, this is strongly contradicted by the extremely small sample size (N=18), which produces unstable estimates and is prone to finding inflated effects. Furthermore, the reported denominator degrees of freedom (93) are mathematically inconsistent with the sample size for this analysis type, suggesting a reporting error or a complex, non-transparent analysis that undermines the finding's credibility.
---
0.15
The study's primary weakness is its extremely small sample size (N=18), which makes it severely underpowered and highly likely that the reported significant result is either a false positive or has a dramatically inflated effect size. Furthermore, there is a major inconsistency between the reported sample size and the F-statistic's degrees of freedom, undermining confidence in the analysis itself. While the p-value is low, these other critical flaws, combined with the moderate complexity of the RM ANOVA in a controversial subfield, suggest a low probability of successful replication.

0.22
The study's primary weakness is its extremely small sample size (N=18), which severely undermines the reliability of the findings and suggests the study is underpowered. Although the reported p-value is low and the first author is well-cited, the contentious nature of the research topic (bilingual advantage), a complex design, and inconsistent reporting (the degrees of freedom are not possible for the given sample size) make a successful replication unlikely. These factors create a high probability that the original result was a false positive or a substantially inflated effect.

The primary concern is the extremely small sample size (N=18), which yields low statistical power and makes findings highly unstable and likely to be overestimated. Although the p‑value is low, significant results from severely underpowered studies often fail to replicate. The complex pattern of mixed null and positive results within a contentious research area (bilingual advantage) further decreases the probability of replication success."

The large sample size (N=154) provides good statistical power, and the finding is supported by very strong statistical evidence, including a very low p-value (<.001) and a large F-statistic that implies a substantial effect size. While the finding is a specific interaction effect, the use of a standard cognitive paradigm (priming) and a common analysis (RM ANOVA) in a controlled lab setting suggests the result is robust.
---
0.88
The prediction is high due to extremely strong statistical evidence; the reported p-value is very low (<.001), the sample size is large for this type of study (N=154), and the F-statistic is large, implying a substantial effect size. While subtle cognitive priming effects can sometimes be fragile, the combination of a well-powered design, a highly significant result, and an established first author makes a successful replication very likely.
---
0.88
This prediction is based on multiple strong positive indicators, chief among them being the very low p‑value (<.001) and the large F-statistic, which suggest a robust effect. This is further supported by the substantial sample size (154) for a cognitive priming study and the high citation count of the author, suggesting a well-established research program. While repeated-measures ANOVA can sometimes involve analytic complexity, the strength of the evidence here outweighs that concern.

The prediction is high due to multiple strong indicators. The study reports a very low p-value (<.001) and a large F-statistic from a reasonably large sample (N=154), which implies a large and precisely estimated effect size that is likely to replicate. Additionally, the high citation count of the first author suggests experience and rigor, and the standard repeated-measures ANOVA in a controlled cognitive experiment increases confidence in the finding's robustness.
---
0.88
The very low p-value (<.001) and large test statistic (F=23.176) imply a substantial effect size, suggesting the finding is statistically robust and not a borderline result. This conclusion is further supported by a good sample size (N=154) for a lab-based cognitive experiment using a standard analysis (RM ANOVA). While priming effects can be sensitive to specific methods, the strong evidence in this case points to a high likelihood of successful replication."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
In a serial recall task, the Hebb repetition effect occurs when recall performance improves for a sequence repeated throughout the experimental session. This phenomenon has been replicated many times. Nevertheless, such cumulative learning seldom leads to perfect recall of the whole sequence, and errors persist. Here the authors report evidence that there is another side to the Hebb repetition effect that involves learning errors produced in a repeated sequence. A learning measure based on past recalls (correct or incorrect) shows that the probability of a given response increases with the number of prior occurrences of that response. The pattern of results reveals another manifestation of the Hebb repetition effect and speaks to the nature of implicit learning.

The study has a very low p-value (<.001) and a large effect size (d=1.51), which are strong positive indicators for replicability. While the sample size is small (N=24), the finding is an extension of the Hebb repetition effect, a well-established and robust phenomenon in cognitive psychology, which increases confidence. The combination of extremely strong statistical evidence and solid theoretical grounding makes a successful replication likely, despite the small sample.
---
0.88
The reported p-value is extremely low (p<.001) and the effect size is very large (d=1.51), both of which are strong predictors of replication success. While the small sample size (N=24) is a significant concern as it can produce unstable and inflated estimates, this is partially offset by the fact that the study investigates an extension of the Hebb effect, a robust and well-established cognitive phenomenon. A well-powered replication is therefore very likely to find a significant result, even if the effect is smaller than what was originally reported.
---
0.78
The study reports a very large effect size (d = 1.51) and a highly significant p-value (<.001), both strong positive indicators for replicability. While the small sample size (N=24) is a major concern and the mixed ANOVA analysis is complex, the sheer magnitude of the reported effect, grounded in a well-established cognitive paradigm, suggests the finding is likely robust enough to replicate successfully.
---
0.82
The prediction is high due to extremely strong statistical evidence (p < .001, d = 1.51) for an extension of the highly robust Hebb repetition effect, a staple of cognitive psychology. While the first author’s modest citation count and the very small sample size (N=24) are notable concerns that suggest the effect size may be inflated, the sheer strength of the signal makes a successful replication probable.
---
0.88
The study reports a very small p‑value (<.001) and an exceptionally large effect size (d = 1.51), which are strong indicators of a robust and replicable finding. Although the sample size (N=24) is a significant weakness, this concern is substantially mitigated by the sheer magnitude of the effect. Furthermore, the finding is an extension of the Hebb repetition effect, a well-established phenomenon in cognitive psychology, which increases its a priori likelihood."

The original study reported a non-significant result (p > 0.1) based on a very small sample (N=16) that found only a small effect size. Given that the study was severely underpowered and failed to find a significant effect, an independent replication is extremely unlikely to achieve statistical significance. The most probable outcome of a replication would be another null finding.
---
0.12
The reported p-value is >0.1, indicating the original finding was not statistically significant, which is the strongest predictor of a failed replication. This weak evidence is compounded by a very small sample size (N=16) and a small effect size (η² = .026). A study with such low statistical power is highly unlikely to produce a significant result in a direct replication attempt.
---
0.05
The primary reason for the very low prediction is that the original study reported a non-significant result (p > 0.1), so a replication is extremely unlikely to achieve statistical significance (p < .05). This is exacerbated by a very small sample size of 16, which is insufficient for a complex analysis like a mixed ANOVA and yields low statistical power. The reported small effect size further suggests that any underlying effect would be difficult to detect reliably.
---
0.15
The study’s reported p-value is non-significant (p > 0.1) and was obtained from a very small sample (N=16), indicating it was severely underpowered and the result is likely inconclusive. While another low-powered study might also yield a null result, the original finding is too unstable to be considered successfully replicated. The minor positive indicators, such as the author's moderate citation count and the study's placement in cognitive psychology, are insufficient to overcome these fundamental statistical weaknesses.
---
0.05
The original study reported a non-significant result (p > 0.1), meaning it failed to find evidence for the effect, so the probability of a replication achieving statistical significance is inherently very low. This conclusion is strongly reinforced by the study's tiny sample size (N=16) and small reported effect size (η² = .026), which together indicate the experiment was severely underpowered and any finding is not robust."

The primary reason for the low replication probability is the combination of a small sample size (N=32) and a p-value (0.03) that is just below the conventional threshold for significance. While the reported effect size is large (ηp² = .143), findings from small studies with marginal p-values are often overestimated and prove difficult to replicate successfully. These statistical weaknesses suggest a high risk of replication failure, despite the study being in a typically rigorous subfield.
---
0.42
The reported p-value of 0.03 is very close to the .05 significance threshold, which is a strong indicator of lower replicability. While the reported effect size is large, the small sample size of 32 means this effect is likely overestimated and the finding is underpowered. These primary statistical weaknesses substantially lower the probability of a successful replication, despite the author's high citation count and the use of a standard within-subjects design.

This prediction is primarily driven by the combination of a small sample size (N=32) and a p-value (0.03) that is just below the conventional threshold for significance, both of which are strong negative predictors of replicability. Although the reported effect size is large, such estimates are often inflated in small, underpowered studies. The complexity of the finding—opposing interactions that cancel out to create apparent additivity—further suggests the result may not be robust and could be difficult to reproduce precisely.

The author's high citation count and the cognitive psychology subfield are positive indicators for replication. However, the p-value of 0.03 is very close to the significance threshold, and the small sample size (N=32) suggests the large reported effect size (ηp² = .143) is likely an overestimation. The statistical weakness of this key test result substantially lowers the probability of a successful replication.

The primary concerns for replication are the small sample size (N=32) and a p-value (p=0.03) that is just below the conventional threshold for significance. This combination suggests the study may have been underpowered and the large reported effect size (ηp²=.143) could be an overestimation due to the “winner’s curse.” While the author is well-established, the statistical weakness and the nuanced nature of the interaction effect make a successful replication less likely."

The primary reason for this low probability is the reported p-value of <.06, which fails to meet the conventional threshold for statistical significance (p<.05). A replication is highly unlikely to find a significant effect when the original study did not. This weak evidence is compounded by the small sample size (n=32), which makes the original estimate less stable and more susceptible to sampling error.

0.25
The primary reason for the low replication estimate is the reported p-value of <.06, which fails to meet the conventional threshold for statistical significance (p < .05) and represents very weak evidence. While the reported effect size appears large, it is likely inflated due to the non-significant p-value and modest sample size, a statistical artifact known as ""winner's curse."" An independent replication of such a fragile, marginally significant finding is unlikely to succeed.

0.20
The most significant factor reducing the likelihood of replication is the reported p-value of <.06, which fails to meet the conventional threshold for statistical significance (p < .05). While the reported effect size is large, this is likely an overestimation due to the small sample size (N=32), which provides low statistical power and produces less stable estimates. A finding that was not statistically significant in the original study is highly unlikely to be significant in a replication attempt.
---
0.18
The most critical factor is the reported p-value of <.06, which fails to meet the conventional threshold for statistical significance (p<.05) and is a strong predictor of replication failure. While the reported effect size is large, the small sample size (N=32) makes this estimate imprecise and likely inflated. The author's experience and the use of a standard cognitive paradigm are positives, but they are insufficient to overcome the weak primary evidence.
---
0.30
The primary reason for this low prediction is the reported p-value of <.06, which is not statistically significant at the conventional alpha level of .05. While the cognitive subfield, controlled experimental design, and large effect size are positive indicators, a non-significant finding from a study with a small sample size is a major red flag for replicability. The effect size estimate is likely inflated, and a replication would need to obtain stronger evidence than the original study, making success unlikely."

The predicted probability is extremely low primarily due to the tiny sample size (N=8), which provides very little statistical power and produces unstable estimates. This concern is amplified by a p-value (p=0.023) that is only barely below the threshold for significance, suggesting the original finding may be a false positive. While the analysis is simple, these two factors strongly indicate that an independent replication is unlikely to succeed.
---
0.25
The primary reasons for this low replication probability are the extremely small sample size (N=8) and the p-value (p=0.023) being just below the standard significance threshold. A study with such a small sample has very low statistical power, meaning a significant finding is more likely to be a false positive or to have a highly inflated effect size estimate. While the analysis is simple and the author is established, these factors do not outweigh the profound statistical weakness of the original evidence.

0.35
The primary indicators of low replicability are the extremely small sample size (N=8) and a p-value (p=0.023) that is only slightly below the conventional significance threshold. Such a combination suggests the result may be statistically fragile and the true effect size is likely overestimated. This concern is amplified by a mathematical inconsistency between the reported t-statistic and the effect size (ηp²), which undermines confidence in the study's rigor, despite the simple analysis type and the author's established reputation.

0.28
The prediction is low primarily due to the extremely small sample size (N=8) and a p-value (0.023) that is just below the conventional significance threshold. While the author's high citation count suggests expertise, findings from such severely underpowered studies are highly susceptible to sampling error and have a lower probability of successful replication. Additionally, the reported effect size (ηp^2) appears inconsistent with the provided t-statistic, which raises minor concerns about reporting accuracy.
---
0.32
This study's probability of successful replication is low due to its extremely small sample size (N=8) and a p-value (p=.023) that is close to the significance threshold. Such characteristics make the finding susceptible to being a statistical artifact (Type I error) and suggest the large implied effect size may be overestimated. While the simple analysis (t-test) and cognitive subfield are positive indicators, the very low statistical power of the original study makes its results fragile."

While the sample size of 37 is small and poses a risk to replicability, this concern is largely offset by the extremely low p-value (<.001) and the massive effect size (ηp² = .427). An effect this large is highly likely to be detected again, even if the original study overestimated its magnitude. The use of a powerful within-subjects design (RM ANOVA) further increases confidence that the finding is robust.

0.88
The extremely low p-value (<.001) and massive effect size (ηp² = .427) provide very strong evidence for a robust phenomenon, making replication highly likely. Although the sample size of 37 is small, the use of a powerful within-subjects design (RM ANOVA) makes this less of a concern. The cognitive psychology context, which often studies fundamental and reliable processes, further supports this high probability.

This study has a high probability of successful replication due to its very strong statistical evidence, including an extremely low p‑value (<.001) and a very large effect size (ηp² = .427). While the sample size of 37 is a weakness, the sheer magnitude of the reported F‑statistic suggests the finding is robust and not a borderline case. The analysis itself, a simple within-subjects comparison, is a powerful design commonly used for reliable findings in cognitive psychology.

This study has a high probability of replication due to its very strong p-value (<.001) and a large effect size (ηp² = .427). Although the sample size is somewhat small, the within-subjects design (RM ANOVA) is powerful for detecting such effects, and the first author's high citation count is a positive indicator for methodological rigor. The robustness of the reported statistics strongly suggests the finding is not a fluke.

0.82
This study has a high probability of successful replication despite the small sample size. The primary reasons are the very strong statistical evidence: an extremely low p-value (p<.001) and a very large effect size (__p^2 = .427). Furthermore, the use of a repeated-measures ANOVA indicates a within-subjects design, which provides more statistical power than a between-subjects design with the same number of participants, partially mitigating the small sample concern."

The primary concern for replicability is the very small sample size (N=24), which can produce unstable results. However, this weakness is counterbalanced by an extremely large reported effect size (__p^2 = .51) and a correspondingly strong F-statistic and low p-value (<.01). While the effect size may be inflated, an effect of this magnitude is likely not spurious and would probably be detected in a well-powered replication, even if its true size is smaller.
---
0.82
The very low p-value (<.01) and large F-statistic signal a statistically robust finding against the null hypothesis. While the small sample size (N=24) and correspondingly massive effect size (ηp²=.51) raise concerns about the accuracy of the effect's magnitude, the presence of five supporting experiments strongly suggests the underlying phenomenon is real. These factors, combined with the study's placement in the more controlled cognitive subfield, make a successful replication highly probable.
---
0.65
While the small sample size (N=24) and complex mixed ANOVA design are risk factors for replicability, the finding is supported by a strong p-value and a series of five experiments. The extremely large effect size (ηp² = .51) is likely an overestimation common in small samples, but the underlying true effect is probably still substantial. The conceptual replication across five studies in the original paper is the strongest indicator that the phenomenon is real and would likely be found again.
---
0.42
This study's primary weakness is its very small sample size (N=24), which provides low statistical power and increases the probability that the finding is a false positive or that the effect size is substantially overestimated. Although the reported p-value is strong (p<.01) and the effect size is extremely large (__p^2=.51), such large effects from small samples are often a red flag for low replicability. The author’s experience (indicated by the high citation count) is a positive sign, but it cannot fully overcome the statistical uncertainty inherent in such a small sample.
---
0.75
The very small sample size is a major concern, as it can lead to inflated effect size estimates. However, this risk is substantially mitigated by the extremely strong evidence presented: a highly significant p-value (<.01), a massive effect size (ηp² = .51), and—most critically—the successful internal replication of the finding across five separate experiments. This pattern suggests a robust underlying phenomenon that is likely to replicate successfully."

The reported study has a very high risk of non-replication. The primary weaknesses are the extremely small sample size (N=12) and a p‑value that is just below the significance threshold of .05, which suggests the finding is statistically fragile. Although the reported effect size is large, such estimates from small samples are often highly inflated, meaning the true effect is likely much smaller and would not be detected in a replication attempt with a more appropriately powered design.
---
0.25
The primary concerns for replication are the extremely small sample size (N=12) and the p-value reported as just under the .05 threshold. Such a small sample yields low statistical power and highly unstable estimates, while a marginal p-value is a known predictor of replication failure. Although the reported effect size is large, it is likely inflated due to the small sample, and a replication would probably find a much smaller effect, if any.
---
0.25
The extremely small sample size (N=12) provides very low statistical power and yields an unstable effect size estimate. Most critically, the reported test statistic of F(1,11) = 4.8 corresponds to a p-value of approximately .051, suggesting the finding is marginal at best and not robust enough to likely replicate. The large reported effect size is probably an inflation characteristic of underpowered studies.
---
0.22
The probability of successful replication is low due to a combination of severe statistical weaknesses. The sample size (N=12) is extremely small, providing low statistical power and leading to unstable estimates. Critically, the reported p-value of <.05 appears to be incorrect, as the provided F-statistic yields a p-value of approximately .051, which is not statistically significant. While the effect size is large, it is likely an overestimation common in underpowered studies with borderline-significant results, and it is unlikely to be reproduced in a replication attempt.
---
0.25
The probability of successful replication is low due to several statistical red flags. The sample size (N=12) is extremely small, leading to low statistical power and an unstable estimate. Crucially, the reported F‑statistic yields a p‑value of approximately .051, which contradicts the reported p<.05 and suggests the finding is fragile and on the barest edge of statistical significance. The very large effect size is likely an inflation due to the low-powered design, and it would probably be much smaller in a high-powered replication."

While the test statistic (z = 3.10) is strong and indicates a highly significant result, the small sample size (N=68) makes the underlying correlation estimates less stable and more prone to error. The high complexity of the statistical method, a ""test of contrast of 4 correlated correlations,"" further increases the risk that the finding is fragile or capitalized on chance. Therefore, despite the compelling z‑score, the combination of a small sample and a complex, sensitive analysis lowers the probability of a successful replication.

0.60
The test statistic (z=3.10) corresponds to a p-value of approximately .002, which is strong evidence against the null hypothesis and favors successful replication. However, this is significantly tempered by the small sample size (N=68), which can produce unstable estimates susceptible to sampling error. The complex, non-standard statistical analysis (""contrast of 4 correlated correlations"") and the failure to report an effect size further increase uncertainty about the finding's robustness.

0.35
The very small sample size (N=68) is a major weakness for a complex analysis involving a contrast of correlated correlations and computational modeling, which suggests the result may be overfit and not generalizable. While the test statistic is strong (z=3.10), the authors' decision to report this as a vague p<.05 instead of its actual, much more significant value (p≈.002) is a red flag for questionable research practices. The combination of a small sample, analytical complexity, and imprecise reporting significantly lowers confidence in the finding's robustness.
---
0.42
The prediction is low despite a strong test statistic (z=3.10, p≈.002) due to several risk factors. The sample size of 68 is very small for a complex analysis involving correlated correlations and cognitive modeling, creating a high risk of an overestimated effect size. The complexity of the analysis itself, combined with the lack of a reported effect size, also reduces confidence in the finding's robustness.
---
0.28
This study's probability of replication is low due to its small sample size and a highly complex, non-standard statistical analysis (test of contrast of 4 correlated correlations). While the test statistic (z = 3.10) is strong, this is offset by questionable reporting practices (p < .05 instead of an exact value, no effect size) and the study’s origin in social psychology, a subfield with historically lower replication rates. These methodological weaknesses suggest the finding may be fragile and difficult to reproduce."

The prediction is high due to the very strong statistical evidence, including a low p‑value (<.01) and a large effect size (ηp² = 0.241). While the sample size of 67 is a notable weakness and suggests the effect size could be overestimated, the sheer strength of the reported signal and use of a simple ANOVA make a successful replication probable. The multi‑study nature of the original paper further increases confidence in the core finding.
---
0.70
The reported p-value is strong (p < .01) and paired with a very large effect size (ηp² = 0.241), suggesting a robust finding that is likely to replicate. However, this optimism is tempered by the small sample size (N=67), which increases the risk that the original effect size is overestimated. Furthermore, studies in social psychology involving complex interactions can be sensitive to subtle procedural differences between labs, introducing an additional element of risk to replication success.
---
0.75
While the sample size of 67 is a notable limitation, the reported evidence is exceptionally strong, featuring a p-value well below the standard threshold (p<.01) and a very large effect size (ηp² = 0.241). The use of a standard ANOVA is straightforward, and the abstract describes a series of four studies supporting the core hypothesis, which suggests the underlying phenomenon is robust and likely to replicate.
---
0.45
The first author's experience and the strong p-value (<.01) are positive indicators for replication. However, the small sample size (N=67) is a significant concern and suggests the extremely large reported effect size (ηp²=0.241) is likely inflated. Such large effects found in small samples are often a product of sampling error, making it less likely that a new study would find a statistically significant result of a similar magnitude.
---
0.62
The reported p-value is low (p<.01) and the effect size is very large (ηp²=0.241), which are strong positive indicators for replicability. However, these results come from a small sample (N=67) in social psychology, a subfield with historically mixed replication rates. Such a large effect in a small sample raises the possibility of an inflated “winner’s curse” effect, making a successful replication likely, but not certain, and probably with a smaller effect size."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
How do youths' personality reports differ from those of adults? To identify the year-by-year timing of developmental trends from late childhood (age 10) to early adulthood (age 20), the authors examined Big Five self-report data from a large and diverse Internet sample. At younger ages within this range, there were large individual differences in acquiescent responding, and acquiescence variability had pronounced effects on psychometric characteristics. Beyond the effects of acquiescence, self-reports generally became more coherent within domains, and better differentiated across domains, at older ages. Importantly, however, different Big Five domains showed different developmental trends. Extraversion showed especially pronounced age gains in coherence but no gains in differentiation. In contrast, Agreeableness and Conscientiousness showed large age gains in differentiation but only trivial gains in coherence. Neuroticism and Openness showed moderate gains in both coherence and differentiation. Comparisons of items that were relatively easy versus difficult to comprehend indicated that these patterns were not simply due to verbal comprehension. These findings have important implications for the study of personality characteristics and other psychological attributes in childhood and adolescence.

First consider the subfield—some areas (e.g., social or developmental psychology) have historically shown lower replication rates—then adjust that judgment based on the specific study’s sample size, p-value, effect size, method complexity, and author citation count.",0.97,0.95,0.92,0.94,0.88,0.932,"0.97
The prediction is overwhelmingly driven by the extremely large sample size (N > 230,000), which ensures that the statistical estimates are highly stable and precise. This is strongly corroborated by the very low p-value (<.001) and large F-statistic, indicating the observed differences in variance across age groups are not due to chance. While the study is observational and describes developmental trends rather than a manipulated effect, a replication with a similarly large sample is almost certain to find the same statistical patterns.
---
0.95
The extremely large sample size (N > 230,000) provides very high statistical power, making the reported p-value (<.001) and large F-statistic highly credible. The finding is a descriptive one about differences in variance across age groups, which is likely a robust phenomenon in a dataset this large. While the practical importance depends on the effect size (not provided), the statistical significance of this core result is almost certain to replicate in any well-powered study.
---
0.92
The massive sample size (N > 230,000) provides extremely high statistical power, making it very likely that the reported findings reflect true effects rather than sampling error. This confidence is bolstered by the exceptionally low p-value (<.001) and the very large F-statistic. Although the full analysis implied by the abstract is complex, the sheer scale of the data provides a robust foundation, suggesting the core developmental trends would be observed again in a replication.
---
0.94
The prediction is high primarily due to the massive sample size (N > 230,000), which provides immense statistical power and ensures the findings are stable and not a product of sampling error. This stability is reflected in the very small p-value and large test statistic, indicating a robust effect. The study’s use of a standard analysis on survey data, along with the first author’s established publication record, further increases confidence in a successful replication.
---
0.88
This study's probability of replication is very high due to its enormous sample size (N > 230,000) and extremely significant p-value (p < .001), which provide overwhelming statistical evidence for the reported effects. While the effect size is likely quite small, as is common in studies with such high power, the sheer precision afforded by the sample makes it very probable that the detected developmental patterns are real and not due to sampling error. The analysis is a standard statistical test, and the descriptive nature of the findings about personality trends is less fragile than a subtle experimental manipulation."

Note:
First consider the subfield—some areas (e.g., social or developmental psychology) have historically shown lower replication rates—then adjust that judgment based on the specific study’s sample size, p-value, effect size, method complexity, and author citation count.",0.35,0.35,0.35,0.35,0.25,0.33,"0.35
The probability is low primarily because the reported p-value of 0.03 is just below the conventional threshold for significance, a range known for lower replication rates. While the sample size of 100 is moderate, it may be insufficient to reliably detect the small-to-medium effect size suggested by the test statistic, increasing the risk of an overestimated initial finding. Additionally, phenomena in social psychology like terror management rely on subtle manipulations that can be difficult to reproduce consistently.
---
0.35
The key factor driving this low prediction is the p-value of 0.03; results that are barely statistically significant have a much lower probability of replicating than those with more extreme p-values. Although the sample size of 100 is not trivial, it offers limited statistical power for the observed small-to-medium effect size, suggesting the original finding may be unstable or overestimated. The topic area, Terror Management Theory, has also faced mixed replication results, which further tempers confidence despite the straightforwardness of the t-test analysis.
---
0.35
The primary concern for this study is the p-value of 0.03, which is just below the conventional significance threshold and suggests the finding may not be robust. The sample size of 100 provides relatively low statistical power for a between-subjects t-test, increasing the chance of an inflated effect size estimate or a false positive. Although the analysis is simple, studies in social psychology using subtle experimental primes like mortality salience have historically faced replication challenges.
---
0.35
The p-value of .03 is just below the conventional significance threshold, and such marginal findings have a lower probability of successful replication. This concern is amplified by the modest sample size for detecting a small-to-medium effect, which suggests the original study may have been underpowered and its effect size overestimated. While the author is well-cited and the analysis is straightforward, these factors are outweighed by the statistical weakness of the key result and known replication challenges within social psychology.
---
0.25
The prediction is low due to several risk factors. The study's reported p-value of 0.03 is just below the significance threshold, a known correlate of lower replicability, and the sample size is only modest. More importantly, there is a major inconsistency between the reported t‑statistic (which implies a medium effect) and the unusually large reported effect size (pr^2 = 0.224), which undermines confidence in the findings."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
General action and inaction goals can influence the amount of motor or cognitive output irrespective of the type of behavior in question, with the same stimuli producing trivial and important motor and cognitive manifestations normally viewed as parts of different systems. A series of experiments examined the effects of instilling general action and inaction goals using word primes, such as ""action"" and ""rest."" The first 5 experiments showed that the same stimuli influenced motor output, such as doodling on a piece of paper and eating, as well as cognitive output, such as recall and problem solving. The last 2 experiments supported the prediction that these diverse effects can result from the instigation of general action and inaction goals.

The prediction for low replicability is driven by several factors. The most significant is the very small sample size (N=36), which provides low statistical power and produces unstable, likely inflated, effect size estimates. Additionally, the reported p-value of 0.02 is close to the conventional cutoff, and findings in this ""p-value purgatory"" are less likely to replicate than more highly significant results. The subfield of social priming, especially from the era this paper was likely published, has a well-documented history of replication failures.

0.15
While the reported p-value of 0.02 is statistically significant, the very small sample size (N=36) makes the finding highly suspect and likely underpowered. Such small samples can produce inflated effect sizes and are more susceptible to false positives, a known issue in the subfield of social priming, where this study is situated. The combination of a borderline p-value and a small sample for such a broad, counterintuitive claim results in a low probability of successful replication.

0.15
This study has a very low probability of replication due to a combination of high-risk factors. The sample size is very small (N=36), increasing the chance of a false positive, and the p-value (p=0.02) is close to the significance threshold. Moreover, the study's topic is a form of social priming, a subfield with a well-documented history of poor replicability, and the large reported effect size is likely inflated due to the low statistical power.

0.22
While the first author is highly cited, suggesting experience, the study's characteristics point to a low probability of replication. The finding is in social priming, a subfield known for replication failures, and relies on a very small sample size (N=36). A p-value of 0.02 is close to the significance threshold, and the large effect size is likely an overestimation common in underpowered studies, making the result unlikely to be robust.
---
0.15
This study has a low probability of replication. It falls within the subfield of social priming, which has a well-documented history of replication failures, and the effect itself (subtle word primes influencing diverse behaviors) is conceptually broad. The finding is supported by a small sample size (N=36) and a p-value (0.02) that is close to the significance threshold, a combination that increases the risk of a false positive or an inflated effect size estimate."

The reported p-value of 0.02 is statistically significant but falls within a range that has been shown to have lower replication rates. The study's topic, broad behavioral priming, is from a subfield of social psychology that has faced a well-documented replication crisis. While the reported medium effect size and moderate sample size are positive indicators, the subject matter and borderline p-value suggest a high risk that the finding is either a false positive or highly context-dependent, making a successful replication unlikely.

The reported p-value of 0.02, while statistically significant, provides only weak evidence and is in a range often associated with replication difficulties. More importantly, this study investigates broad behavioral effects of priming, a paradigm from social psychology that has a well-documented, low rate of successful replication. The modest sample size for a between-subjects design also increases the likelihood that the reported medium effect size is an overestimate.

0.15
This study's low predicted replicability stems from two major factors: its subfield of social priming, which has a poor replication record, and its p-value of 0.02, which is worryingly close to the conventional 0.05 threshold. Although the reported medium effect size and simple ANOVA are positive signs, they are unlikely to overcome the high prior probability of a false positive associated with this research area and marginal p‑value.

While the author is highly cited and the reported effect size is medium, several factors suggest a low probability of replication. The study's p-value of 0.02 is close to the significance threshold, which is negatively correlated with replication success. Most importantly, the study investigates broad behavioral effects of conceptual priming, a research paradigm within social psychology that has a well-documented history of failed replications.

This study investigates social priming, a topic within social psychology that has a notably poor replication record. The reported p-value of 0.02 is statistically significant but worryingly close to the .05 threshold, a factor strongly associated with replication failure.

This prediction is based on the combination of a small effect size (η² ≈ .04) and a p-value that, while significant, is not overwhelmingly low (p < .02). Small effects are inherently more difficult to replicate reliably, and findings in the subfield of social-cognitive priming have a mixed record of reproducibility due to their sensitivity to subtle contextual factors. Although the sample size of 133 is reasonable, the low signal strength makes a successful independent replication less certain.
---
0.45
The reported p-value of <.02, while statistically significant, is not highly convincing and falls within a range that has historically shown lower replication rates. This weak evidence is coupled with a small effect size (η² = .04), suggesting the phenomenon may not be very robust and could be difficult to detect consistently. Although the sample size is reasonable for a repeated-measures design, the combination of a p-value close to the .05 threshold and a small effect lowers the predicted likelihood of a successful replication.
---
0.35
The probability is low due to several key factors. The reported p‑value (<.02) is significant but close to the .05 threshold, and the effect size (η²=.04) is small, a combination that often predicts replication failure. Furthermore, the study falls within the subfield of social-cognitive psychology, where similar priming effects have historically proven difficult to replicate, despite the original paper's promising series of five experiments.

While the authors’ claim of finding the effect across five studies and the moderate citation count suggest some robustness, the provided statistics for this specific experiment are weak predictors of replication. The p-value (<.02) is statistically significant but worryingly close to the .05 threshold, and the small effect size (ηp² ≈ .04) would require a large sample for a replication attempt to be well-powered. These factors make a successful replication of this particular study uncertain.
---
0.35
Although the sample size is reasonably large, the reported p-value is close to the .05 threshold and the effect size is small, two statistical indicators that lower the probability of replication. Priming and affective manipulation studies in social-cognitive psychology are also notoriously sensitive to context and have shown mixed replication success historically. While the use of multiple studies is a positive sign, the core statistical evidence from the reported study remains weak."

A low probability is predicted due to the combination of a small sample size and a p-value (p=.03) that is very close to the conventional significance threshold. Findings with these characteristics are often statistically fragile and have a high chance of being false positives or substantial overestimates of the true effect. The complexity of the methods, combining self-report, a behavioral task, and neuroimaging (ERP), also introduces additional potential for variability between studies.
---
0.25
The reported p-value of 0.03 is weak evidence that is often associated with lower replicability. This concern is amplified by the small sample size (N=48), which suggests the large reported effect size (ηp² = .16) may be inflated and the original finding could be a false positive. The methodological complexity, involving ERP data and a mixed ANOVA, introduces additional potential challenges for an independent replication.
---
0.25
This study has a low probability of replication due to several risk factors. The reported p‑value of .03 is just below the conventional significance threshold, and such marginal results are often less robust. Furthermore, the small sample size (N=48, with only 33 in the key analysis) provides low statistical power and likely produced an inflated effect size estimate. The complex mixed ANOVA design, particularly in a field like social neuroscience that measures noisy signals, increases the potential for analytic flexibility that can undermine replicability.
---
0.28
The first author’s high citation count is a positive indicator, but the finding’s statistical evidence is weak. A p-value of .03 is very close to the significance threshold and a strong predictor of lower replicability, while the small sample size increases the chance that the large reported effect size is an overestimation. The complexity of a mixed ANOVA design combined with neurophysiological measures further reduces the likelihood of a successful replication.
---
0.35
This study’s likelihood of replication is low due to several statistical red flags. The p-value of .03 is just under the conventional threshold for significance, and such ""fragile"" results often fail to replicate. This is compounded by a small sample size for the reported F-test (N=33), which can lead to inflated effect sizes and low statistical power. While the first author is well-established, these factors, combined with the study's placement in social psychology—a subfield with historically mixed replication success—suggest a low probability of a successful replication."

The primary negative indicator is the reported p-value, which is extremely close to the .05 significance threshold (an F-value of 3.19 with these degrees of freedom yields p≈.048), a strong predictor of replication failure. While the sample size (N=57) is moderate for a repeated-measures design and the effect size (ηp²=0.11) is substantial, this combination often suggests the finding is fragile and the reported effect is an overestimation, making a successful replication less probable.

The strongest predictor against replication is the reported p-value of <.05, which, based on the F-statistic, is approximately .049. Such a ""p-just-so"" result is very close to the significance threshold and has a low probability of replicating. While the reported effect size is medium-to-large, this can be an overestimation in an underpowered study, and the methodological complexity of a neurofeedback experiment further decreases the likelihood of a successful replication.
---
0.35
The reported p-value is just below the .05 threshold, which is a strong negative predictor of replication success. While the effect size is medium-to-large and the author is well-established, these are counteracted by the borderline p-value and the complexity of the study design, which combines a classic social psychology paradigm with a difficult-to-implement neurofeedback manipulation. A moderate sample size of 57 is not large enough to overcome these concerns.
---
0.32
The very high author citation count suggests experience, which is a positive sign. However, the reported test statistic yields a p-value just under the .05 threshold (p ≈ .048), a factor strongly associated with lower replication success. This, combined with a moderate sample size and a complex experimental procedure involving neurofeedback, suggests the original result may be fragile and difficult to reproduce.
---
0.40
This prediction is moderately low due to several competing factors. On one hand, the reported effect size (ηp^2 = 0.11) is large and the sample size (N=57) is adequate for a repeated-measures design. However, the reported p-value of <.05 is just at the threshold of significance, a factor strongly associated with lower replication rates, and the complex methodology integrating neurofeedback with a social psychology paradigm introduces many potential points of failure in a replication attempt."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
Previous research on the communication of emotions has suggested that bargainers obtain higher outcomes if they communicate anger than if they communicate happiness because anger signals higher limits, which in turn leads opponents to give in. Building on a social functional account of communicated emotions, the authors demonstrate that the behavioral consequences of communicated anger strongly depend on structural characteristics of the bargaining situation. The results of 3 experimental studies on ultimatum bargaining corroborate the notion that communicated anger signals higher limits and that emotion effects are contingent on bargainers' expectation that low offers will be rejected. The data also indicate, however, that communicating anger in bargaining may backfire. The findings suggest that bargainers who communicate anger may obtain lower outcomes (a) when their opponent has a possibility to deceive them during bargaining and (b) when the consequences of rejecting their opponent's offer are low. Taken together, the current article reveals the boundary conditions of successful communication of anger in bargaining.

First consider the subfield—some areas (e.g., social or developmental psychology) have historically shown lower replication rates—then adjust that judgment based on the specific study’s sample size, p-value, effect size, method complexity, and author citation count.",0.85,0.88,0.92,0.88,0.85,0.876,"0.85
This study has a very high probability of replication due to its strong statistical evidence, including a very low p-value (p<.0001) and a large effect size (ηp²=0.14). While the sample size of 103 is only moderate, it was more than sufficient to detect such a large effect. The main risk factor is that social interaction effects can be sensitive to subtle contextual changes, but the reported statistics are compelling enough to suggest the finding is robust.
---
0.88
The prediction is high due to the exceptionally strong evidence reported. The very low p‑value (p < .0001) and large effect size (ηp² = .14) together suggest a robust finding that is not likely to be a statistical artifact. While the moderate sample size and the study's focus on complex interactions could pose minor challenges, the strength of this specific reported effect makes a successful replication highly probable.
---
0.92
This study is highly likely to replicate due to its very strong statistical evidence, including an extremely low p-value (p<.0001) and a large effect size (ηp² = 0.14). The moderate sample size is sufficient for such a large effect, and the use of a standard ANOVA limits concerns about analytical complexity. The main reported finding appears very robust, even if the subtler interactions mentioned in the abstract may be more difficult to reproduce.
---
0.88
This study has a very high probability of replication due to its combination of extremely strong statistical evidence and indicators of methodological rigor. The very low p-value (p<.0001) and large effect size (ηp²=0.14) from a well-understood ANOVA suggest the effect is substantial and not a statistical artifact, and this finding is further supported by the high-citation author and a sample size that was well-powered for an effect of this magnitude. The fact that the original paper presents a series of three experiments also demonstrates internal robustness, making a successful independent replication highly likely.
---
0.85
While social psychology has historically shown lower replication rates, this specific finding is supported by very strong statistical evidence. The extremely low p-value (p<.0001) and large effect size (ηp² = 0.14) are the most powerful predictors of replication success. The sample size is also adequate for detecting an effect of this magnitude, suggesting the result is robust."

This prediction is below 0.5 primarily due to the small reported effect size (ηp² = 0.028) and a p-value that is statistically significant but not highly convincing. Such small effects are often difficult to detect reliably, and a finding with this level of evidence could easily be a result of sampling variation that would not reappear in a new study. While the sample size of 186 is decent for the field, it may not be large enough to overcome the inherent instability of a small effect, making a successful replication less likely.
---
0.32
The primary reason for this prediction is the combination of a small effect size (ηp² = 0.028) and a p-value reported as just under the conventional threshold for significance. While the sample size is moderate for the field, it was likely only just sufficient to detect this small effect, making the finding fragile and difficult to reproduce without a substantially larger replication sample. The study also proposes a complex multi-step model, and such intricate causal chains are often more challenging to replicate than simple, direct effects.
---
0.28
The primary reason for the low replication probability is the combination of a p-value reported as just under the .05 threshold and a small effect size (ηp² = 0.028). This pattern suggests the original study may have been underpowered, making such a finding less likely to be robust, even with a decent sample size. Furthermore, the study proposes a complex, multi-step psychological model within social psychology, a subfield where subtle effects can be context-dependent and difficult to reproduce.
---
0.41
This prediction is driven primarily by the combination of a small effect size (ηp² = 0.028) and a p-value just meeting the traditional cutoff for significance (p < .05). Such results are more likely to be statistical overestimates and have a lower probability of successful replication than findings with stronger evidence. Although the first author's citation count is high and the sample size is moderate, these positive factors are outweighed by the weak statistical evidence for the reported effect, which is characteristic of findings that prove difficult to reproduce.
---
0.25
The reported p-value is just under the .05 threshold and the partial eta-squared of 0.028 indicates a small effect size. This combination is highly suggestive of a finding that is not robust and has a low probability of replication, as it may be an overestimated effect or a false positive. Additionally, the study's home in social psychology and its complex, multi-step theoretical model further decrease the likelihood that an independent replication would succeed."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
In 5 studies, the authors tested predictions that (a) people project their own felt communal responsiveness onto partners, perceiving partners to be just as caring and supportive as they are, and (b) projected perceptions guide perceivers' orientation toward further promotion of communal relationships. In Study 1, a manipulation of felt communal responsiveness toward a partner affected perceptions of the partner's responsiveness to the self, which in turn predicted evaluation of the partner. In Study 2, a manipulation of responsiveness toward a new acquaintance biased perceptions of the acquaintance's responsiveness to the self, which in turn predicted attraction and warmth toward the new acquaintance. In Studies 3 and 5, participants' own felt communal responsiveness toward a friend appeared to bias their perceptions of the friend's communal responsiveness, which in turn predicted self-disclosure, evaluation of the friend (Studies 3 and 5), and support provision (Study 5). Initial projected perceptions of a friend's (Study 3) and of a spouse's (Study 4) communal responsiveness also predicted longitudinal changes in perceivers' communal responsiveness. Results suggest that those who care for partners often project that care and that this projection guides their relationship promotion.

First consider the subfield—some areas (e.g., social or developmental psychology) have historically shown lower replication rates—then adjust that judgment based on the specific study’s sample size, p-value, effect size, method complexity, and author citation count.",0.92,0.88,0.82,0.86,0.85,0.866,"0.92
The probability of replication is very high, primarily because the finding was demonstrated across five separate studies using both experimental and longitudinal methods. This strong study design is supported by compelling statistical evidence, including an extremely low p-value (<.001) and a massive effect size (R² = .68) for a sample of this size. The combination of conceptual replication within the original paper and the strength of the reported statistics suggests the effect is robust and very likely to be found again.
---
0.88
The prediction is high due to the extremely strong evidence reported. The p-value is very low (<.001), and the reported effect size is massive (R² = .68), suggesting a powerful and easily detectable phenomenon that should replicate even with a modest sample size (N=153). While the multilevel model is complex and social psychology has a varied replication record, the sheer statistical strength of the finding, combined with its internal replication across five studies in the original paper, makes a successful replication very likely.
---
0.82
The reported p-value is very low (<.001) and the effect size is extremely large (R² = .68), which are both strong positive indicators for replicability. Although the use of a complex multilevel model can introduce analytic flexibility that reduces replication likelihood, the sheer magnitude of the reported effect in a study with an adequate sample size (N=153) makes a successful replication highly probable. The effect is so large that it should be easily detectable even if the original result was somewhat inflated.
---
0.86
The prediction is high due to the combination of a very strong p-value (<.001) and an exceptionally large effect size (R2 = .68), suggesting a highly robust phenomenon. The first author's solid citation count and an adequate sample size (N=153) further increase confidence in the finding's stability. While the analytical complexity of a multilevel model can sometimes pose a challenge for exact replication, the strength of the primary evidence makes a successful replication highly probable.

0.85
This study has an extremely high probability of successful replication. The reported p-value is very low (p < .001) and the effect size is exceptionally large (R² = .68), both of which are strong predictors of replicability. While social psychology has historically lower replication rates and the analysis is complex, the strength of the statistical evidence combined with a decent sample size (N=153) makes the finding very likely to be robust."

This study has a good chance of replication due to its grounding in established theory, its plausible and medium-sized effect (d = .45), and the simplicity of the t-test analysis. While the sample size is only moderate and the p-value is not extremely low (p≈.02), these weaknesses are offset by the straightforward experimental manipulation and a successful conceptual replication reported in the paper (Study 2), which bolsters confidence in the core finding.
---
0.68
The reported p-value is moderately strong (calculated as p≈.021 from the t-statistic), which is the primary driver of this prediction. The likelihood is further increased by the study’s simple experimental design and analysis (an independent-samples t-test), which limits researcher degrees of freedom. However, the small-to-medium effect size (d = .45) and moderate sample size (N=110) suggest the effect estimate may be somewhat imprecise, slightly reducing confidence in a successful replication.

0.60
The analysis is a simple independent-samples t-test, which limits analytic flexibility and is a positive indicator for replicability. However, this is tempered by a p-value that is close to the significance threshold of .05 and a small-to-medium effect size. While the sample size is adequate for a lab study, these mixed signals suggest a moderate, but not certain, probability of successful replication.

0.48
While the first author is established and the t-test is a simple analysis, the study's statistical evidence is somewhat weak. With a moderate sample size of 110, the study has low statistical power for the observed small-to-medium effect size (d = .45). This low power, combined with a p-value that is close to the significance threshold of .05, tempers confidence and suggests the result may be difficult to replicate.
---
0.62
While social psychology studies have historically shown lower replication rates, this study has several strengths. The sample size (N=110) is adequate for a two-group design, and the analysis is a simple t-test, which reduces the potential for analytical errors or hidden moderators. Although the p-value is not extremely low (calculated p≈.02 from the t-statistic), the plausible effect size (d=.45) and the straightforward, conceptually-grounded experimental manipulation increase its likelihood of successful replication."

In 2 studies, the author examined the relationship between an individual's attempts to avoid bias (measured in Study 1, manipulated in Study 2) and 1/f noise in implicit measures of stereotyping and prejudice. In each study, participants who made an effort to modulate the use of racial information showed less 1/f noise than did participants who made less effort. The potential value of this analytic approach to social psychology is discussed.

Key details:
- Sample size: 71
- Analysis type (e.g. rm ANOVA, mixed ANOVA, regression, t‑test): between ANOVA using planned orthogonal contrasts
- Test statistic: F(1, 68) = 5.52
- Reported p‑value: <.02
- Effect size (e.g. Cohen’s d, r): d=.56
- First author’s citation count: 2379
- Subfield: Cognitive, Social

Note:
First consider the subfield—some areas (e.g., social or developmental psychology) have historically shown lower replication rates—then adjust that judgment based on the specific study’s sample size, p-value, effect size, method complexity, and author citation count.",0.38,0.48,0.35,0.38,0.45,0.408,"0.38
The reported p-value is just under the .05 significance threshold and the sample size is modest for a between-subjects design, both of which are risk factors for replication. The primary concern is the complexity of deriving the dependent variable (1/f noise), as this non-standard data processing introduces analytical flexibility that can be difficult for other labs to reproduce exactly. While the medium effect size is a positive sign, the combination of marginal statistical significance and high methodological complexity suggests a low-to-moderate probability of successful replication.
---
0.48
The reported p-value of <.02 is significant but not highly compelling, and the moderate sample size of 71 provides relatively low statistical power to reliably detect the reported medium-sized effect (d=.56). While the finding is theoretically interesting, the novel and complex nature of the 1/f noise analysis introduces procedural steps that may be difficult to reproduce exactly, increasing the risk of a replication failure. The established author provides some confidence, but this is outweighed by the statistical and methodological concerns.
---
0.35
This prediction is low primarily due to the p-value being close to the .05 threshold, which is a strong negative indicator for replicability. While the reported effect size is medium, the modest sample size (N=71) and the high procedural complexity of measuring 1/f noise from reaction times introduce substantial uncertainty. Novel findings that rely on complex or unfamiliar methodologies are often more difficult to reproduce successfully.
---
0.38
The primary concerns for replication are the p-value being just under the conventional .05 threshold and the high complexity of the dependent variable (1/f noise), which may be sensitive to subtle procedural or analytic variations. While the experienced author and medium effect size (d=.56) are positive indicators, these are counteracted by the weak statistical evidence and a sample size that provides limited power to detect a fragile effect. The combination of a marginal p-value and a complex method makes a successful replication less likely.
---
0.45
The prediction is below 0.5 primarily due to the p‑value (<.02) being close to the conventional significance threshold, which is associated with lower replicability, and the study’s subfield of social psychology. Furthermore, the novel and complex methodology involving 1/f noise analysis may introduce unstated procedural dependencies that are difficult to reproduce precisely. While the reported medium effect size (d=.56) is a positive indicator, it is not strong enough to fully overcome the risks posed by the other factors."

The reported p-value is extremely low (<.0001) and the effect size is very large (ηp² = .362), both of which are strong positive indicators for replicability. Although the sample size (n=82) is modest and the subfield has faced replication challenges, the sheer statistical strength of the effect and its internal replication across five experiments suggest the finding is robust. The well-established author and standard ANOVA analysis further increase confidence in the result.
---
0.88
The extremely low p-value (<.0001) and very large effect size (ηp² = .362) provide strong evidence for a robust phenomenon, suggesting a high likelihood of replication. While the sample size is moderate and social-cognitive priming effects can be sensitive to procedural details, the sheer magnitude of the reported effect makes it likely to be detected in a direct replication. The experienced author and standard analysis further bolster this prediction.
---
0.85
The reported statistical evidence is exceptionally strong, with a very low p-value (p<.0001) and a very large effect size (ηp² = .362). This combination is the single best predictor of a successful replication. While the sample size (N=82) is not massive, it is more than adequate for detecting an effect of this magnitude, and the use of a standard ANOVA is unlikely to introduce confounding analytic flexibility.

0.82
Despite the modest sample size, the reported statistical evidence is exceptionally strong, with a very low p-value (<.0001) and an extremely large effect size (ηp² = .362). While mindset-priming effects from social cognition can be context-sensitive and difficult to replicate, the sheer magnitude of this effect and the high citation count of the lead author suggest a robust phenomenon. Therefore, a successful replication is quite likely.
---
0.85
Despite social psychology's generally lower replication rates for priming studies, this finding has a high probability of replicating. The reported p-value is exceptionally low (<.0001) and the effect size is very large (ηp² = .362), both of which are strong predictors of replicability. While the sample size is not large, it is sufficient to detect such a massive effect, suggesting the finding is robust."

The small sample size and associated large effect size are notable risk factors, as such findings can be unstable and inflated. However, these concerns are substantially outweighed by the abstract reporting a series of seven studies using diverse methodologies (e.g., experimental, correlational) that all demonstrated the core effect. This strong pattern of internal replication suggests the phenomenon is robust, making a successful independent replication highly probable.
---
0.68
The prediction is driven by the very strong reported evidence: the p-value is well below .01 and the partial eta-squared of .186 indicates a large effect. While these are strong positive predictors of success, confidence is significantly reduced by the very small sample size (N=45). Such small samples are prone to producing inflated effect size estimates, especially within the subfield of social psychology.
---
0.45
The primary concern is the very small sample size (N=45), which suggests the large reported effect size may be an overestimation and that the finding is not stable. While the p-value is strong (p<.01) and the ANOVA is a simple analysis, these positive signals are substantially undermined by the low statistical power and the general replicability challenges within social psychology. The likelihood of successfully replicating this specific result is therefore modest.
---
0.70
The prediction is moderately high due to the strong statistical evidence, including a low p‑value (<.01) and a large effect size (ηp² = .186). However, the small sample size (N=45) is a significant concern, as it often leads to inflated effect sizes and less stable results. This risk is somewhat mitigated by the first author's high citation count, which may indicate greater methodological rigor, and the finding being one of seven reported in the paper.
---
0.65
The reported p-value is strong (p < .01) with a large effect size (ηp² = .186), which suggests a robust finding. However, this optimism is tempered by the very small sample size (N=45), which can inflate effect size estimates and makes the result less stable. While social psychology has shown lower replication rates, the strength of the statistical evidence here suggests a better-than-even chance of a successful replication, assuming the true effect is not drastically smaller than what was reported."

Note:
First consider the subfield—some areas (e.g., social or developmental psychology) have historically shown lower replication rates—then adjust that judgment based on the specific study’s sample size, p-value, effect size, method complexity, and author citation count.",0.35,0.35,0.32,0.3,0.25,0.314,"0.35
The key predictors of a failed replication are present: a p-value very close to the .05 significance threshold and a small reported effect size (ηp² = 0.035). This combination suggests the original finding is fragile, and the modest sample size (N=122) provides low statistical power to reliably detect such a small effect again. The subfield of social psychology has also historically had a lower rate of successful replications for subtle effects like this one.
---
0.35
The primary reason for this low prediction is the p-value, which at approximately .044 (based on the F-statistic) is very close to the .05 threshold and is a strong indicator of low replicability. This weak evidence is coupled with a small effect size (ηp² = 0.035) and a modest sample size (N=122), suggesting the original study was underpowered and may have capitalized on chance. While the ANOVA analysis is straightforward, the combination of a barely-significant p-value and a small effect makes a successful replication unlikely.
---
0.32
The prediction is low primarily due to the combination of a p-value just under the .05 threshold and a small effect size (ηp² = 0.035), two of the strongest predictors of replication failure. While the sample size is moderate and the ANOVA is a standard analysis, the weak statistical evidence for a finding in social cognition—a subfield with historically mixed replication rates—suggests a high chance of a null result in a replication attempt.
---
0.30
The primary drivers for this low prediction are the reported p-value being just under the .05 significance threshold and the small effect size (ηp² = 0.035). This combination suggests the original study (N=122) was underpowered to reliably detect such a small effect, increasing the risk of a false positive or an inflated effect estimate. While the author is experienced and the ANOVA is a simple analysis, these positive factors do not overcome the statistical weakness of the reported result.
---
0.25
The reported p-value is just under the .05 threshold and the effect size is small (ηp² = 0.035), a combination that makes the finding statistically fragile and less likely to replicate. The sample size is not large enough to provide a stable estimate or high power for a small effect. Additionally, the study's subfield, social psychology, has historically demonstrated lower replication rates for published findings."

The prediction for high replicability is primarily driven by the very large effect size (average proportion of 0.78), which indicates a robust and easily detectable phenomenon. This is further supported by the simple, straightforward analysis (binomial test) that limits researcher degrees of freedom, and a multi-study design that establishes the effect across diverse populations, including a crucial non-Western, isolated sample. While the total sample size is moderate, it is more than sufficient to reliably detect an effect of this magnitude.
---
0.88
Although the reported p-value of <.05 is imprecise and suggests potentially marginal significance, this concern is strongly outweighed by the very large effect size (average recognition proportion of 0.78). The study’s high likelihood of replication is further supported by its use of a simple binomial test, which is less susceptible to analytical errors, and a robust multi-study design that provides conceptual replication. The established author and the fundamental nature of the research question also suggest the finding is likely to be solid.
---
0.88
The prediction is high due to the very large effect size (average proportion of 0.78) and the use of a simple binomial test, which minimizes the potential for p‑hacking via complex analytical choices. While a reported p‑value of <.05 can be a weak indicator, the large effect and decent sample size suggest the finding is robust and the actual p‑value is likely very low. The strong cross‑cultural design, particularly the inclusion of an isolated preliterate tribe, further bolsters confidence in the result's replicability.
---
0.72
The first author’s high citation count suggests expertise, and the very strong effect size (78% recognition) and simple binomial analysis are strong positive predictors of replication. The primary concern is the imprecise p-value of <.05, which often indicates a marginally significant result and lowers replication chances. Overall, the strength and simplicity of the core finding suggest a successful replication is more likely than not.
---
0.88
This prediction is high primarily due to the very large effect size and the simplicity of the statistical analysis. An average recognition proportion of 0.78 is a strong signal that is likely to be detected again, and a simple binomial test has few researcher degrees of freedom that could produce a spurious result. While social psychology has a mixed replication history, the topic of universal emotion recognition has proven relatively robust, and the sample size is adequate for such a large effect."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
In 7 different studies, the authors observed that a large number of thinking biases are uncorrelated with cognitive ability. These thinking biases include some of the most classic and well-studied biases in the heuristics and biases literature, including the conjunction effect, framing effects, anchoring effects, outcome bias, base-rate neglect, ""less is more"" effects, affect biases, omission bias, myside bias, sunk-cost effect, and certainty effects that violate the axioms of expected utility theory. In a further experiment, the authors nonetheless showed that cognitive ability does correlate with the tendency to avoid some rational thinking biases, specifically the tendency to display denominator neglect, probability matching rather than maximizing, belief bias, and matching bias on the 4-card selection task. The authors present a framework for predicting when cognitive ability will and will not correlate with a rational thinking tendency.

The probability of successful replication is high due to the combination of a large sample size (N=375) and a very low p‑value (p<.001), both of which are strong predictors of replicability. This confidence is further bolstered by the respectable effect size (d=0.493), the straightforward t‑test analysis which minimizes methodological ambiguity, and the first author’s extensive citation count suggesting a high level of expertise.

0.92
This finding has a very high probability of replication, primarily due to the highly significant p-value (p < .001) combined with a solid sample size (N=375) for the field. The reported medium effect size (d=0.493) is substantial enough to be reliably detected, and the simple t-test analysis reduces the chances of unreplicable complexity. The finding also comes from a highly-cited author in a foundational area of cognitive psychology, increasing confidence in its robustness.

The likelihood of successful replication is very high. This prediction is based on the combination of a large sample size (N=375), a highly significant p-value (p<.001), and the use of a simple, transparent statistical analysis (an independent t-test) which limits analytic flexibility. While the effect size is moderate, the high-powered nature of the original study and the first author's status as a leading expert in the field further support the finding's robustness.

0.91
This study has a high probability of successful replication due to several strong factors. The large sample size (N=375) provides substantial statistical power, and the resulting p-value is highly significant (p<.001), making a false positive unlikely. Furthermore, the effect size is a plausible small-to-medium (d≈0.5), the analysis is a simple t-test, and the first author is extremely well-established, all of which increase confidence in the finding's robustness.

This study has a very high probability of successful replication due to several strong indicators. The sample size (N=375) is large, providing high statistical power, and the resulting p-value is highly significant (p<.001), suggesting the finding is not a statistical fluke. The analysis is a simple t-test, which is transparent and less prone to error, and the first author is an exceptionally well-established expert in the field."

The prediction is high due to the combination of a large sample size (N=261) and a highly significant p-value (p=.002), which indicates a statistically robust result. Although the effect size is small-to-medium (ηp^2 = .042), the original study was sufficiently powered to detect it, and the use of a standard ANOVA for the analysis is straightforward. These factors together suggest a high likelihood of a successful replication for the core finding.
---
0.72
A very low p-value (p = .002) combined with a decent sample size (N = 261) strongly suggests the reported main effect is robust and likely to replicate. However, the effect size is only small-to-medium (ηp² = .042), and the study proposes a mediation mechanism, which is inherently more complex and fragile than the simple ANOVA presented. These factors temper the initial optimism, leading to a moderately high prediction.
---
0.72
The prediction is relatively high due to a solid sample size and a strong p-value (p=.002) for a standard ANOVA, suggesting a robust finding. This confidence is tempered by the small-to-medium effect size (ηp²=.042), which can be difficult to detect consistently, and the mixed replication history within the social psychology subfield. While the statistical evidence for this specific effect is good, a successful replication would still require a similarly well-powered design.
---
0.78
This prediction is primarily based on the strong p-value (p = .002) and a solid sample size (N = 261), both of which are robust predictors of replication success. While the effect size (ηp^2 = .042) is somewhat small and the subfield of social psychology has a mixed replication history, these concerns are mitigated by the study's statistical strength and the low complexity of the core ANOVA. The author's moderate citation count further provides a small boost to the estimate of replicability.
---
0.68
The low p-value (0.002) and respectable sample size (N=261) are strong positive indicators for replication. However, this is tempered by the study’s subfield (social psychology), which has a history of lower replication rates, and a small-to-medium effect size (ηp^2 = .042). While the main effect is likely to be found, the complex causal claim about mediation may be more challenging to fully reproduce."

The sample size (N=37) is very small, which provides low statistical power and produces unstable estimates. Furthermore, the test statistic (X^2=3.85) corresponds to a p-value that is just barely below the .05 significance threshold, a strong statistical signature of a finding that is unlikely to replicate. While the reported effect size is moderate, such estimates are often inflated in small, underpowered studies.

0.25
The reported p-value is just below the conventional .05 threshold for significance, which is a strong predictor of replication failure. This weak evidence is further undermined by the very small sample size (N=37), which increases the likelihood of a chance finding and produces an imprecise effect size estimate. While the analysis method is simple, these factors are not enough to overcome the high risk associated with a barely significant result from a small study.

This study has a very low probability of replication due to the combination of a tiny sample size (N=37) and a p-value that is just under the conventional significance threshold of .05. This pattern suggests the study was underpowered and the result is statistically fragile, with the reported medium effect size likely being a substantial overestimation. While the simple statistical analysis is a positive factor, the weak evidentiary value from the p-value and sample size are strong indicators of a likely replication failure.

This study's probability of replication is low. While the author's citation count is respectable and the reported effect size is medium, these are strongly counteracted by two major weaknesses: the very small sample size (N=37) and a p-value that is just barely below the .05 significance threshold. Such ""p-just-so"" results from small samples are often statistically fragile and less likely to replicate successfully.

0.32
The prediction for a low probability of replication is driven by the combination of a very small sample size (N=37) and a p-value that is just under the .05 significance threshold. These factors suggest the original finding may be statistically fragile and susceptible to sampling error, which is a concern in social psychology, a field with historically variable replication rates. While the reported effect size is medium, its estimate is likely inflated and unreliable given the weak primary evidence."

This study has several positive indicators for replication, including a good sample size for the design and a finding demonstrated across four separate experiments, which suggests internal robustness. However, the reported effect size is small (ηp²=0.041), and interaction effects in social psychology are often more difficult to replicate than main effects. The strong p-value and standard analysis method are positive signs, but the small effect magnitude remains the primary source of uncertainty.

The reported p-value of <.01 suggests a result unlikely to be a false positive, and the sample size of 246 provides adequate statistical power for the small-to-medium effect size (ηp²=0.041). However, the finding is a relatively complex interaction effect in social psychology, a combination that has historically shown mixed replication success. Therefore, while the statistical evidence is solid, the subtlety of the effect tempers the prediction to be moderately high.
---
0.70
This prediction is moderately high due to the combination of a strong p-value (<.01) and a decent sample size (N=246), which reduces the likelihood that the original result was a statistical fluke. While the effect size is small-to-medium (ηp²=0.041) and the core finding is a more fragile interaction effect, confidence in the phenomenon's robustness is significantly increased because it was demonstrated across four separate studies. A successful replication would need to be carefully designed and well-powered, but the evidence suggests the effect is likely real.

0.52
While the author's citation count is a modest positive, the prediction is primarily driven by competing statistical signals. The strong p-value (<.01) and adequate sample size (N=246) argue in favor of replication. However, the reported effect size is small (ηp² = 0.041), and such effects are inherently less robust; furthermore, complex interaction effects are often more difficult to successfully replicate than main effects.
---
0.66
The prediction is moderately high due to a strong p-value (p<.01), an adequate sample size, and the finding being demonstrated across four separate studies. However, confidence is tempered because the effect size is only small-to-medium (ηp² = 0.041) and interaction effects in social psychology can be more context-dependent and thus harder to replicate than main effects."

The reported p-value is just below the .05 significance threshold, and the sample size is small, two factors strongly associated with lower replication rates. Although the reported effect size is large, such effects found in small samples are often inflated due to sampling error and publication bias. The study's focus on a mind-set priming effect—a type of finding from social psychology that has historically proven difficult to replicate—further reduces its predicted likelihood of success.

The probability of successful replication is low due to several key weaknesses. The sample size is very small, which provides low statistical power and increases the chance of a false positive, while the p-value is just below the .05 threshold, a range associated with lower replicability. Furthermore, the reported large effect size is likely an overestimation given the low power, and subtle ""mind-set"" effects in social psychology have historically proven difficult to replicate."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
The authors propose that conflict threatens different psychological resources of victims and perpetrators and that these threats contribute to the maintenance of conflict (A. Nadler, 2002; A. Nadler & I. Liviatan, 2004; A. Nadler & N. Shnabel, in press). On the basis of this general proposition, the authors developed a needs-based model of reconciliation that posits that being a victim is associated with a threat to one's status and power, whereas being a perpetrator threatens one's image as moral and socially acceptable. To counter these threats, victims must restore their sense of power, whereas perpetrators must restore their public moral image. A social exchange interaction in which these threats are removed should enhance the parties' willingness to reconcile. The results of 4 studies on interpersonal reconciliation support these hypotheses. Applied and theoretical implications of this model are discussed.

Note:
First consider the subfield—some areas (e.g., social or developmental psychology) have historically shown lower replication rates—then adjust that judgment based on the specific study’s sample size, p-value, effect size, method complexity, and author citation count.",0.65,0.75,0.65,0.68,0.45,0.636,"0.65
This study has a moderate sample size and a medium effect size (ηp² = .07), which are positive indicators for replication. While the reported p-value of ""<.05"" can be a flag for lower replicability, the actual p-value calculated from the F-statistic is closer to .01, suggesting a reasonably robust finding. The main risk is that social psychology effects can be sensitive to subtle contextual factors, making direct replication of a social interaction paradigm challenging.
---
0.75
The calculated p-value for this F-statistic is approximately .01, which is considerably stronger than the reported p<.05 threshold and is a strong positive indicator for replication. This is combined with a medium effect size (ηp² = .07) and a sample size (N=94) that is adequate to detect it. The simple between-subjects ANOVA design reduces the risk of analytical errors or p‑hacking, further bolstering confidence in the result.
---
0.65
The statistical analysis is a simple between-subjects ANOVA, which limits analytical flexibility. The reported F‑statistic corresponds to a p‑value of approximately .01, which is a strong signal, and the effect size (ηp² = .07) is of a medium magnitude. While the sample size of 94 provides only moderate statistical power, the strong p‑value and straightforward experimental design suggest a better-than-average chance of replication.
---
0.68
The prediction is supported by strong statistical evidence: the p-value (p≈.01 for F(1,90)=6.98) is well below the typical threshold, and the sample size provides adequate power for the reported medium effect size (ηp²=.07). While the author’s moderate citation count is a minor positive indicator, this is balanced by the study’s subfield (social psychology) and a potentially complex experimental manipulation, which can pose challenges for direct replication.
---
0.45
This study is in social psychology, a field with historically low replication rates, and has a modest sample size. However, the reported effect size is medium (ηp² = .07) and the F-statistic implies a p-value closer to .01 than the .05 threshold, which are positive indicators. The straightforward ANOVA is also a plus, though the abstract nature of the constructs could pose a challenge for direct replication."

The probability of successful replication is low due to the small sample size (N=50) and a p-value reported as just under the .05 threshold, which are strong predictors of non-replication. Furthermore, the analysis is a partial correlation with low degrees of freedom, suggesting many covariates were controlled for, which increases the risk of finding an unstable or spurious result in a small dataset. While the effect size is moderate, the weakness of the statistical evidence makes the finding unlikely to hold up.
---
0.25
The prediction is low due to several converging factors that suggest a fragile result. The reported p-value is just below the .05 threshold, a range strongly associated with lower replication rates. This weak evidence is compounded by a small sample size (N=50) and a complex analysis for that sample (a partial correlation controlling for eight covariates), which increases the risk of a spurious finding.
---
0.35
The prediction is low due to the combination of a small sample size (N=50) and a p-value reported as just under the .05 threshold, two strong indicators of poor replicability. Although a partial correlation is a standard analysis, the degrees of freedom (df=41) suggest that seven covariates were controlled for, which introduces significant analytic flexibility and increases the chance of a spurious finding. These factors suggest the result is fragile and unlikely to replicate successfully.
---
0.35
The prediction is low because weak statistical evidence outweighs the author's high citation count. A small sample size (N=50) combined with a p-value just under the .05 threshold indicates low statistical power and a high risk that the finding is a false positive or that the effect size is overestimated. The complexity of a partial correlation on a small sample further increases the risk of an unstable result, making a successful replication unlikely.
---
0.22
The probability is low due to the combination of a small sample size (N=50) and a p-value reported as just below the significance threshold of .05. These factors suggest the original study was underpowered, increasing the risk that the medium-sized effect (r=.30) is an overestimation or a false positive. This concern is heightened within the subfield of social psychology, which has historically faced replication challenges."

The authors propose that different available information quantities moderate these contradictory findings. Four studies confirmed this expectation. When confronted with 10 pieces of information, decision makers systematically preferred decision-consistent information, whereas when confronted with only 2 pieces of information, they strongly preferred decision-inconsistent information (Study 1). This effect was not due to differences in processing complexity (Study 2) or dissonance processes (Study 3) but could be traced back to different salient selection criteria: When confronted with 2 pieces of information, the salient selection criterion was information direction (consistent vs. inconsistent), which caused a preference for inconsistent information. In contrast, when confronted with more than 2 pieces of information, the salient selection criterion was expected information quality, which caused a preference for consistent information (Study 4).

First consider the subfield—some areas (e.g., social or developmental psychology) have historically shown lower replication rates—then adjust that judgment based on the specific study’s sample size, p-value, effect size, method complexity, and author citation count.",0.55,0.78,0.82,0.35,0.62,0.624,"0.55
While the reported p-value is very low and the effect size is large, the study's small sample size (N=52) is a significant concern, as results from small samples are often unstable and overestimate true effects. However, this is partially counterbalanced by the use of a simple analysis and the fact that the abstract describes a series of four studies supporting the conclusion, which suggests some internal robustness. Thus, the overall probability is moderate, weighing the weak sample against the strong reported evidence.
---
0.78
The very strong p-value (p=.001) and large effect size (d=1.17) are powerful predictors of a successful replication, suggesting a robust underlying phenomenon. This confidence is tempered primarily by the small sample size (N=52), which increases the risk that the effect size is an overestimation. However, the sheer strength of the statistical evidence and the simplicity of the analysis (Chi-squared) suggest the finding is more likely than not to replicate.
---
0.82
This study has a high likelihood of replication due to its very strong statistical evidence, including a low p‑value (0.001) and a very large effect size (d=1.17). The simple Chi‑squared analysis also minimizes analytic flexibility, which boosts confidence in the finding. While the sample size of 52 is small, the strength of the reported effect suggests it is robust and would likely be detected again in a replication attempt.
---
0.35
The very low p‑value and established author suggest a potentially robust finding. However, the small sample size is a significant weakness, making the extremely large reported effect size likely to be an overestimate and difficult to reproduce. Such complex interaction effects in social psychology, where a preference completely reverses based on a subtle manipulation, often prove less stable in replications than simpler main effects.
---
0.62
This prediction balances the study's strengths and weaknesses. The very small sample size (N=52) and associated large effect size are significant risk factors for replicability, as is the subfield of social psychology. However, these concerns are substantially mitigated by the very low p-value (p=.001), the simple statistical analysis, and the fact that the core finding was internally replicated across four separate studies, suggesting the effect is robust."

The study's foundation in ego depletion is a major concern, as this area of social psychology has notoriously low replication rates. This concern is amplified by the relatively small sample size for a between-subjects design and a p-value of .02, which is close to the significance threshold and often associated with less robust findings. Although the reported effect size is medium-to-large, such effects are frequently inflated in small studies, making a successful independent replication unlikely.
---
0.22
The reported p-value of 0.02 provides only weak evidence, as it is just below the common .05 threshold and is associated with lower replicability. This weak signal is further undermined by the study's reliance on the concept of ""ego depletion,"" a topic within social psychology that has a well-documented history of failed replications. The modest sample size (N=85) also increases the likelihood that the reported medium-to-large effect size is an overestimation.
---
0.25
The prediction is low primarily because the study relies on the ego-depletion paradigm, a concept from social psychology that has famously failed to replicate in large-scale studies. Furthermore, the reported p-value of 0.02 is just below the conventional significance threshold, a range known to have lower replicability, and the sample size is modest for a 3-group between-subjects design. While the effect size is notable, this positive signal is outweighed by the weak p-value and the precariousness of the underlying theory.

The study's focus on ego depletion is a major concern, as this area of social psychology has a well-documented history of failed replications. Furthermore, the small sample size and a p-value of 0.02, which is close to the .05 threshold, suggest the result may be statistically fragile and the medium-to-large effect size is likely overestimated. While the first author is reasonably well-established, these core methodological and topical weaknesses point to a low probability of successful replication.

The prediction is low primarily because the study investigates ego depletion, a topic within social psychology with a well-documented history of replication failures. This concern is amplified by the study's relatively small sample size and a p‑value of .02, which is close to the traditional significance cutoff of .05. These factors suggest a high risk that the original result was a statistical artifact or that the reported effect size is substantially inflated, making a successful replication unlikely."

Despite a strong p-value (p<.01) and a large reported effect size, the small sample size of 55 for a between-subjects design is a major weakness, increasing the likelihood that the effect is overestimated. Furthermore, stereotype threat is a subtle social psychology phenomenon that has historically shown high variability in replication success, making the original finding less certain to reproduce. The simple analysis is a positive factor, but it does not outweigh the concerns about statistical power and the context-dependent nature of the effect.

0.45
While the reported p-value (<.01) is strong, the very small sample size (N=55) for a between-subjects design is a significant weakness that increases the risk of both false positives and effect-size inflation. The large reported effect size (__p^2 = .16) is less believable given the small sample and may not be reproducible. Studies in this subfield of social psychology have also faced replication challenges, which tempers confidence despite the strong initial statistics.

While the study reports a large effect size (ηp² = .16) and a p‑value well below .05, these promising signals are undermined by a small sample size (N=55) for a between‑subjects design. Such small, low‑power studies can produce inflated effect size estimates, and the subfield of social psychology has historically faced replication challenges for subtle experimental manipulations. Therefore, the strong reported result is tempered by the risk that it is an overestimation, leading to a moderate probability of successful replication.

The prediction is low primarily due to the very small sample size (N=55) for a between-subjects design, which produces low statistical power and increases the odds that the large reported effect size is an overestimation (i.e., ""winner's curse""). While the strong p-value (<.01) and the author's established record are positive signals, they are counteracted by the study's context. Findings in social psychology on subtle phenomena like stereotype threat can be highly dependent on context and have shown mixed results in replication efforts.

The prediction is below 0.5 primarily due to the small sample size for a between-subjects design, a major risk factor for replication failure in social psychology. While the p-value is strong (<.01) and the effect size is large (ηp² = .16), such impressive results from low-powered studies are often inflated and difficult to reproduce. The sensitivity and complexity of the stereotype threat paradigm can also make it dependent on subtle contextual factors not present in a replication attempt."

First consider the subfield—some areas (e.g., social or developmental psychology) have historically shown lower replication rates—then adjust that judgment based on the specific study’s sample size, p-value, effect size, method complexity, and author citation count.",0.88,0.85,0.85,0.85,0.72,0.83,"0.88
The study's primary finding is a clear null effect (p=.48) with a negligible effect size (r=.04), meaning a successful replication would also find a non-significant result. Given the very high p-value from the original study, it is highly probable that a replication study with a similar moderate sample size would also fail to find a significant effect. While the analytical method is complex, the evidence against the effect is so strong that the original conclusion is very likely to be upheld.
---
0.85
This study's primary conclusion is a null finding (p = .48), which is supported by a trivial effect size (r = .04) and a moderate sample size. A successful replication would mean again failing to find a significant effect, which is highly probable given the strong initial evidence for the null. While the analysis is complex, the decisiveness of the null result suggests it is likely to be robust.

0.85
The study’s central claim is a null finding (i.e., an absence of sex differences), which is strongly supported by a very high p-value (0.48) and a trivial effect size (r = .04). While the complex meta-analysis of multilevel models could indicate analytical flexibility, it is difficult to produce such a clear null result through questionable research practices, which more often produce fragile positive findings. Given the strong evidence for a null effect and a reasonable sample size, an independent replication is highly likely to also fail to find a significant effect, thus confirming the original conclusion.
---
0.85
This study reports a clear null effect (p = .48, r = .04), which is generally more likely to replicate than a marginally significant result. The moderate sample size and the first author's solid citation count lend credibility to this finding. While the analytical method is highly complex, the coherence of the statistics with the null hypothesis suggests the result is robust rather than an artifact of questionable research practices.
---
0.72
This study reports a clear null finding (p = .48) with a very small effect size (r = .04), and robust null effects are often replicable. However, the high analytical complexity—summarizing 14 multilevel models—and the suspiciously low degrees of freedom for the sample size introduce uncertainty and suggest the results might be sensitive to specific analytical choices. While the social psychology subfield has a mixed replication history, the strong evidence for a null effect here suggests a replication is more likely than not to find a similar non-significant result."

First consider the subfield—some areas (e.g., social or developmental psychology) have historically shown lower replication rates—then adjust that judgment based on the specific study’s sample size, p-value, effect size, method complexity, and author citation count.",0.78,0.68,0.72,0.58,0.45,0.642,"0.78
This prediction is based on several strong indicators, including a p-value well below .05, a highly cited first author, and a programmatic series of nine studies supporting the overall model. These factors suggest a robust and well-vetted finding. However, the moderate sample size and small-to-medium effect size (sr^2=.07) temper this optimism slightly, as replicating such an effect requires a well-powered, carefully conducted study.
---
0.68
The reported p-value is strong (< .01), and the associated effect size (sr^2 = .07) is in the small-to-medium range, both of which are positive signs for replicability. However, the sample size (N=91) is somewhat modest for a hierarchical regression analysis, which can be sensitive to idiosyncratic sample characteristics. The complexity of the model and the study's subfield (social psychology) add a small degree of uncertainty, tempering the otherwise solid statistical evidence.
---
0.72
The reported p-value is strong (<.01) and the effect size is medium (sr² = .07), which are the most important positive signals for replicability. Although the sample size is only moderate and hierarchical regression offers some analytic flexibility, these concerns are mitigated by the compelling conceptual support from the other eight experiments mentioned in the abstract. The combination of strong statistical evidence for this specific finding and the broader evidence from the research program suggests a high likelihood of replication success.
---
0.58
This prediction is moderately optimistic due to a strong p-value (<.01), a medium effect size (sr² = .07), and an experienced first author. However, this confidence is tempered because the sample size of 91 is only moderate for a complex hierarchical regression, potentially leading to an overestimated effect. Furthermore, complex interaction effects in social psychology can be difficult to replicate precisely due to their sensitivity to subtle contextual factors.
---
0.45
While the reported p-value is strong (<.01) and the effect size is medium, the study's subfield (social psychology) and its high theoretical and methodological complexity are significant risk factors. The relatively small sample size (N=91) offers limited statistical power for the complex hierarchical regression analyses used. Such intricate experimental designs, especially those involving manipulations of executive control and implicit measures, are often difficult to replicate precisely, leading to a moderate probability of success."

The present studies suggest that because upward counterfactual thoughts indicate reasons for a poor performance, they can also serve as excuses. In this case, upward counterfactual thoughts should result in more positive self-esteem and reduced future motivation. Five studies demonstrated these effects in the context of self-handicapping. First, upward counterfactual thinking was increased in the presence of a self-handicap. Second, upward counterfactual thoughts indicating the presence of a self-handicap protected self-esteem following failure. Finally, upward counterfactual thoughts that protect self-esteem reduced preparation for a subsequent performance as well as performance itself. These findings suggest that the consequences of upward counterfactuals for affect and motivation are moderated by the goals of the individual as well as the content of the thoughts.","Cognitive, Social",1,"# System

Researchers interested in counterfactual thinking have often found that upward counterfactual thoughts lead to increased motivation to improve in the future, although at the cost of increased negative affect. The present studies suggest that because upward counterfactual thoughts indicate reasons for a poor performance, they can also serve as excuses. In this case, upward counterfactual thoughts should result in more positive self-esteem and reduced future motivation. Five studies demonstrated these effects in the context of self-handicapping. First, upward counterfactual thinking was increased in the presence of a self-handicap. Second, upward counterfactual thoughts indicating the presence of a self-handicap protected self-esteem following failure. Finally, upward counterfactual thoughts that protect self-esteem reduced preparation for a subsequent performance as well as performance itself. These findings suggest that the consequences of upward counterfactuals for affect and motivation are moderated by the goals of the individual as well as the content of the thoughts.

Key details:
- Sample size: 28
- Analysis type (e.g. rm ANOVA, mixed ANOVA, regression, t‑test): independent samples t-test
- Test statistic: t(26) = 1.87
- Reported p‑value: <.05
- Effect size (e.g. Cohen’s d, r): d = .736
- First author’s citation count: 828
- Subfield: Cognitive, Social

Note:
First consider the sample size—larger samples generally contribute to more stable and replicable findings—then incorporate the other metrics (p-value, effect size, method complexity, author citations, and subfield) to give a balanced probability.","# System

Note:
First consider the subfield—some areas (e.g., social or developmental psychology) have historically shown lower replication rates—then adjust that judgment based on the specific study’s sample size, p-value, effect size, method complexity, and author citation count.",0.25,0.22,0.15,0.18,0.18,0.196,"0.25
The very small sample size (N=28) provides low statistical power and suggests the large reported effect size may be an unstable overestimation. Furthermore, the test statistic produces a p-value just barely under the .05 significance threshold, a characteristic strongly associated with findings that fail to replicate. These statistical weaknesses greatly diminish the likelihood of a successful replication, despite the simple analysis type.
---
0.22
The predicted probability is low primarily due to the combination of a very small sample size and a p-value just under the .05 threshold, which was likely obtained via a one-tailed test. While the reported effect size is large, such estimates are often inflated and unreliable in underpowered studies. These factors suggest the original result has a high chance of being a false positive or that the true effect is too small to be reliably detected.
---
0.15
The likelihood of successful replication is very low due to multiple significant weaknesses. The extremely small sample size (N=28) means the study was severely underpowered, and the large reported effect size is likely an overestimate. Most critically, the reported test statistic (t(26) = 1.87) yields a p-value of .072 (two-tailed), which contradicts the claim of p < .05 and suggests either a reporting error or p-hacking.
---
0.18
The extremely small sample size (N=28) for a between-subjects design severely underpowers the study and increases the likelihood of a false positive or an inflated effect size. The reported test statistic (t=1.87) is only significant with a one-tailed test, and the resulting p‑value is precariously close to the .05 threshold, a combination that has been shown to predict low replicability. Although the author is experienced, these major statistical weaknesses suggest the original finding is unlikely to replicate successfully.
---
0.18
The prediction is very low due to the extremely small sample size (N=28), which provides low statistical power and leads to unstable, likely inflated, effect size estimates. Furthermore, the reported p‑value is “just-significant” and potentially inconsistent with the t‑statistic for a standard two-tailed test, suggesting the finding is statistically fragile. These factors, combined with the study's origin in social psychology—a field with historically lower replication rates—make a successful replication unlikely."

This study has a high probability of successful replication due to its very strong statistical evidence; the p-value (0.001) is well below the standard threshold and the effect size (ηp² = .14) is large. While the sample size of 90 is only modest, it is likely sufficient for detecting such a robust effect. The use of a standard ANOVA also reduces the risk of non-replicability from complex or idiosyncratic analyses.

The prediction is high primarily due to the very strong p-value (p=0.001) and the large reported effect size (ηp² = .143), which together suggest a robust finding unlikely to be a statistical fluke. Although the sample size (N=90) is somewhat modest for a between-subjects design, the strength of the statistical evidence provides significant confidence. The use of a standard ANOVA and the plausible, theory-driven nature of the social-psychological effect also support a higher likelihood of replication.

This study has a high probability of replication due to the very strong reported evidence; the p-value is low (.001) and the effect size is large (ηp² = .143). Although the sample size is moderate and social psychology findings can be context-dependent, the statistical strength of the finding and the use of a standard ANOVA make it likely to be robust. The finding is also theoretically well-grounded, further increasing confidence in its replicability.
---
0.82
The prediction is high due to the very strong statistical evidence; the reported p-value of .001 and large effect size (__p^2 = .14) both point to a robust finding that should replicate easily. This confidence is bolstered by the high citation count of the first author, suggesting expertise, and the use of a standard ANOVA. While the social psychology topic could be sensitive to context, the strength of the reported statistics is the most critical factor and makes a successful replication highly likely.
---
0.72
The prediction is moderately high due to the combination of a very strong p-value (p = .001) and a large effect size (ηp² = .14), which suggest a robust finding. While the subfield of social psychology has shown lower replication rates historically and the sample size is moderate, the strength of the statistical evidence for this specific effect significantly increases confidence in its replicability. The straightforward ANOVA analysis also favors successful replication."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
People construe the world along a continuum from concretely (focusing on specific, local details) to abstractly (focusing on global essences). We show that people are more likely to interpret the world abstractly when they experience cognitive disfluency, or difficulty processing stimuli in the environment, than when they experience cognitive fluency. We observed this effect using three instantiations of fluency: visual perceptual fluency (Study 1b), conceptual priming fluency (Study 2b), and linguistic fluency (Study 3). Adopting the framework of construal theory, we suggest that one mechanism for this effect is perceivers' tendency to interpret disfluently processed stimuli as farther from their current position than fluently processed stimuli (Studies 1a and 2a).

Note:
First consider the subfield—some areas (e.g., social or developmental psychology) have historically shown lower replication rates—then adjust that judgment based on the specific study’s sample size, p-value, effect size, method complexity, and author citation count.",0.25,0.15,0.22,0.18,0.25,0.21,"0.25
Although the sample size is moderate, the reported p-value of exactly 0.05 is a strong negative predictor, suggesting the result is fragile and may have been achieved through p-hacking. This concern is compounded by the small effect size (phi = .13), which would require a substantially larger sample than the original to be detected reliably in a replication. The subfield of social cognition has also had historical difficulties replicating subtle effects like those induced by fluency manipulations.
---
0.15
The reported p-value of 0.05 is the strongest indicator of low replicability, as it represents the weakest possible evidence to claim statistical significance and is often associated with failed replications. This borderline result is coupled with a small effect size (phi = .13) and a sample size that was underpowered to detect such a subtle effect reliably. Furthermore, the finding is in social cognition, a subfield where similar subtle priming effects have often proven difficult to replicate.
---
0.22
This study has a low predicted replication success rate primarily due to its very weak statistical evidence: a small effect size (phi = .13) and a p-value that is exactly at the traditional threshold for significance (p = .05). Such “just-significant” results from studies that are not highly powered are often found to be false positives or inflated estimates. While the simple chi-squared analysis reduces analytic flexibility, this positive sign is not enough to overcome the strong negative indicators of a fragile, hard-to-detect effect.
---
0.18
The primary reason for this low prediction is the reported p-value of exactly 0.05, which suggests a statistically marginal and fragile finding that has a low probability of replicating. This is compounded by a small effect size (phi = .13), indicating the original study was likely underpowered to detect such a subtle effect reliably with its given sample size. While the first author is well-cited and the analysis is simple, these factors are insufficient to overcome the strong statistical evidence pointing to a non-robust result.
---
0.25
The reported p-value of exactly 0.05, combined with a small effect size (phi = .13), suggests the original finding is fragile and may have been underpowered. Furthermore, social-cognitive priming effects like this one, which link a subtle manipulation (disfluency) to an abstract outcome (construal level), have historically shown low rates of successful replication. The modest sample size is insufficient to overcome these significant concerns."

This prediction is slightly above chance due to conflicting indicators. The primary weakness is the small sample size (N=36), which increases the risk of a spurious finding and suggests the very large effect size (d=0.82) is likely inflated. However, even if the true effect is smaller, it may still be substantial enough to be detected again, and the use of a standard ANOVA reduces concerns about methodological complexity.
---
0.35
The reported p-value is just under the .05 threshold, a range known to have lower replication rates. This concern is amplified by the small sample size (N=36), which suggests the very large reported effect size (d=0.82) is likely an unstable overestimation. Although the analysis is standard, these statistical weaknesses in a study with a potentially noisy child population present a significant challenge for a successful replication.
---
0.60
The reported large effect size (d=0.82) and simple ANOVA analysis are positive indicators for replication. However, these are tempered by the small sample size (N=36) and a p-value that is significant but not highly robust (the F-statistic corresponds to p≈.02), increasing the chance that the original effect size is an overestimation. The use of young children as participants can also introduce variability that makes effects more difficult to reproduce consistently.
---
0.35
The prediction is low primarily due to the combination of a small sample size (N=36) and a vague p-value reported as just under the significance threshold of .05. This pattern suggests the study had low statistical power, making the large reported effect size likely an overestimation that is difficult to replicate. The complexity of testing a specific linguistic interaction in young children further reduces the probability of a successful replication.
---
0.35
The primary weaknesses are the small sample size (N=36) and a p-value that is significant but not highly robust (p < .05), which both lower the probability of replication. While the reported effect size is large (d=0.82), such effects are often overestimated in small samples and may not be as strong in a higher-powered replication attempt. The developmental nature of the study with young children can also introduce noise, making the specific interaction effect more difficult to reproduce."

The study's reported p-value is just below the threshold for significance (p≈.04, inferred from the t-statistic), a range strongly associated with lower replication rates. This concern is amplified by the study's subfield, as social priming effects have historically proven difficult to replicate. While the analysis is simple, the modest sample size (N=86) for a between-subjects design suggests the study was underpowered and the observed effect size may be an overestimation.
---
0.20
The reported t-statistic corresponds to a p-value of approximately .04, which is just below the conventional significance threshold and is a strong predictor of lower replicability. This borderline evidence is further weakened by the modest sample size for an independent-groups design, which yields high uncertainty around the reported effect size. Furthermore, the study's topic of nonconscious priming falls within a subfield of social psychology that has historically faced significant replication challenges.

The predicted probability is low due to several red flags. The reported test statistic corresponds to a p-value just under the .05 significance threshold, a strong predictor of replication failure. This, combined with a moderate sample size providing low statistical power, suggests the original result may be a false positive or the effect size is highly inflated. Furthermore, the study's topic of nonconscious priming falls within a subfield of psychology that has historically faced significant replication challenges.
---
0.15
The reported p-value is just barely significant (p≈.04), and its presentation using the now-discredited `prep` statistic is a major red flag for a borderline result. This weak evidence, combined with a small sample size (N=86) and a topic in social priming—a subfield with a history of poor replicability—makes a successful replication highly unlikely. The modest effect size is likely an overestimate typical of underpowered studies.
---
0.15
The study's focus on nonconscious priming, a topic within social psychology with historically low replication rates, is a primary concern. This risk is compounded by a small sample size (N=86) and a test statistic that yields a p-value just below the .05 significance threshold. These factors strongly suggest the original finding is fragile and has a high probability of being a false positive or an overestimated effect."

The prediction is high due to the convergence of very strong statistical evidence. The study combines a large sample size (N=280) with an exceptionally large effect size (ηp²=.326) and a highly significant p-value (p<.001), which are the strongest predictors of replication success. Additionally, the use of a standard analytical model and a theory-driven cognitive approach suggests a robust methodology, increasing confidence that the finding is stable and not a statistical artifact.

The reported p-value is extremely low (<.001), and it is supported by a very large effect size (ηp² = .326) and a solid sample size (N=280). This combination of strong statistical evidence suggests the finding is robust and easily detectable. The use of a standard statistical framework (GLM) and a precise modeling approach further increases the likelihood of a successful replication.

The prediction is moderate due to competing factors. While the study benefits from a plausible theory building on the robust anchoring effect, a standard analysis, and a significant p-value (p ≈ .011), its small sample size (N=59) is a major weakness that increases the risk of an overestimated effect. Furthermore, a significant inconsistency between the reported F-statistic and the effect size (η² = .02 vs. an implied η² ≈ .11) raises concerns about reporting accuracy, lowering confidence in its replicability.
---
0.35
While the p-value is statistically significant (p ≈ .01, derived from the F-statistic), it falls within a range that historically has a low replication rate. This concern is significantly amplified by the small sample size and small reported effect size, a combination that suggests the original study was underpowered and the result may be an overestimated or false positive finding. Even with a highly-cited author and a standard analysis, the weak statistical evidence makes a successful replication unlikely.
---
0.42
The primary concern for replication is the very low statistical power, stemming from a combination of a small sample size (N=59) and a small reported effect size (η² = .02). While the analysis method (ANOVA) is straightforward and the underlying cognitive theory is plausible, the statistical evidence is weak. An exact replication would likely be underpowered to reliably detect such a small effect, suggesting the original significant finding may have been a chance occurrence or an overestimate of the true effect.
---
0.62
The high author citation count and the study's basis in the well-established anchoring literature are positive indicators. However, the sample size is small, and a significant inconsistency exists between the reported F-statistic and the very small effect size (η² = .02). This discrepancy reduces confidence in the stability of the reported effect and makes it more uncertain.
---
0.35
This prediction is low due to a major inconsistency between the reported F-statistic and the very small effect size, which undermines the report's credibility. While the study investigates a plausible extension of a robust cognitive bias, the small sample size (N=59) provides low statistical power and increases the risk of an overestimated effect. A p-value of approximately .01, derived from the F-statistic, is not strong enough to overcome these significant statistical weaknesses."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
Here, we document, for the first time, the pull toward contrasting responses during evaluative thinking, reporting the results of a study examining the trajectory of participants' reaching movements toward different response options. The data for this study come from 141 college-age participants (97 females, 44 males) who responded to 11 yes/no questions presented in random order over headphones. The questions were derived from propositions in the Internet-based Mindpixel project and had varying truth values (defined as the proportion of participants who responded that they were true). These results show that both the spatial extent and the temporal dynamics of motor movements can provide insight into high-level cognition. Our results are consistent with previous claims regarding proposition verification. Specifically, we found that evaluating a proposition as false exhibits more difficulty compared with evaluating a proposition as true. Not only were ""NO"" responses slower than ""YES"" responses, but the ""YES"" alternative conspicuously competed with the ""NO"" alternative. Thus, reasoning about the truth value of a proposition exhibits a significant a priori bias toward ""truth,"" and this bias must be overcome before a ""false"" response can come to fruition.

- Effect size (e.g. Cohen’s d, r): r = -0.7
- First author’s citation count: 233
- Subfield: Cognitive, Social

Note:
First consider the subfield—some areas (e.g., social or developmental psychology) have historically shown lower replication rates—then adjust that judgment based on the specific study’s sample size, p-value, effect size, method complexity, and author citation count.",0.25,0.22,0.25,0.32,0.25,0.258,"0.25
While the reported effect size is large (r=-0.7) and the participant N appears adequate (141), the statistical analysis is a major concern. The ANOVA's error degrees of freedom (df=9) are extremely low and inconsistent with the participant sample size, suggesting the analysis was performed on a much smaller effective sample (e.g., items), leading to low statistical power. Such small-N analyses are prone to producing inflated and unstable effect estimates, and coupled with a p-value simply reported as <.05, this finding has a low probability of replication.
---
0.22
While the reported p-value is just below the conventional threshold and the effect size is very large, the study's replicability is highly questionable. The most critical issue is the severe discrepancy between the sample size (N=141) and the degrees of freedom in the test statistic (F(1, 9)), which suggests that the analysis was likely run on a small, select subset of the data or conditions. This practice of ""p-hacking"" or selective reporting drastically reduces the chances that the finding would replicate in a new, independent sample.
---
0.25
The reported ANOVA F(1, 9) statistic is a major red flag; with 141 participants, these degrees of freedom suggest a by-item analysis that inappropriately ignores participant-level variance, a method known to inflate false-positive rates. Although the participant sample is decent and the reported effect size is large (r = -0.7), this effect size is derived from the flawed analysis and is likely a massive overestimation. A modern replication using a more appropriate mixed-effects model would almost certainly find a much smaller, and likely non-significant, effect.
---
0.32
The low replication probability is primarily due to the low denominator degrees of freedom (df=9), which is inconsistent with the large participant sample (N=141). This implies a low-powered analysis was performed on items rather than participants, which can produce spurious results. While the effect size is large, it is likely inflated due to this low power, and the p-value is significant but not highly convincing, making the result precarious.
---
0.25
The prediction is low primarily due to the reported test statistic, F(1, 9) = 8.7, which indicates a very low-powered analysis that does not seem to leverage the full participant sample of 141. This statistical discrepancy, combined with a very large effect size (r = -0.7) and an imprecise p-value (<.05), suggests the result is at high risk of being a false positive or a substantial overestimation of the true effect. The complexity of motor-tracking paradigms can also pose challenges for direct replication."

The probability is high due to the combination of a very large effect size (d = .93) and extremely strong statistical evidence (t = 10.36, implying p < .001). While the sample size of 125 is moderate, it is more than sufficient to reliably detect an effect of this magnitude. Furthermore, the use of a simple single-sample t-test reduces the risk of analytical errors or hidden complexity, making the finding very likely to replicate.

The reported evidence is exceptionally strong, characterized by a very large test statistic (t=10.36) that implies a minuscule p‑value. This is corroborated by a large effect size (d=.93) and an adequate sample size (N=125), suggesting the finding is robust and the study was well-powered. The simplicity of the statistical analysis (a single-sample t‑test) further enhances confidence in the result by reducing the possibility of analytical errors or questionable research practices.

0.92
This prediction is high due to a confluence of very strong positive indicators. The statistical analysis is a simple single-sample t-test, which minimizes analytic flexibility, and the reported effect size is large (d = .93). This large effect, combined with a very low p-value (implied by the huge t-statistic) and a respectable sample size for a lab study, suggests a robust and easily detectable finding that is very likely to replicate.

0.92
This study has a very high probability of successful replication due to its extremely large effect size (d = 0.93) and correspondingly low p-value (implied by t(124) = 10.36). Confidence is further increased by the adequate sample size (N=125), the simplicity of the statistical analysis, and the first author's high citation count, which suggests experience. These factors combined point to a robust and easily detectable effect.

Although social psychology has a mixed replication history, this study's reported evidence is exceptionally strong. The very large effect size (d = .93) and correspondingly high test statistic (t = 10.36), combined with a sufficient sample size and simple analysis, suggest the finding is robust. Such a powerful and precisely-estimated signal is very likely to replicate successfully."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
Episodic memory enables individuals to recollect past events as well as imagine possible future scenarios. Although the episodic specificity of past events declines as people grow older, it is unknown whether the same is true for future events. In an adapted version of the Autobiographical Interview, young and older participants generated past and future events. Transcriptions were segmented into distinct details that were classified as either internal (episodic) or external. Older adults generated fewer internal details than younger adults for past events, a result replicating previous findings; more important, we show that this deficit extends to future events. Furthermore, the number of internal details and the number of external details both showed correlations between past and future events. Finally, the number of internal details generated by older adults correlated with their relational memory abilities, a finding consistent with the constructive-episodic-simulation hypothesis, which holds that simulation of future episodes requires a system that can flexibly recombine details from past events into novel scenarios.

Key details:
- Sample size: 32
- Analysis type (e.g. rm ANOVA, mixed ANOVA, regression, t‑test): RM ANOVA
- Test statistic: F(1,30) = 14.49
- Reported p‑value: prep = .99
- Effect size (e.g. Cohen’s d, r): __p^2= 0.326
- First author’s citation count: 6138
- Subfield: Cognitive, Social

Note:
First consider the subfield—some areas (e.g., social or developmental psychology) have historically shown lower replication rates—then adjust that judgment based on the specific study’s sample size, p-value, effect size, method complexity, and author citation count.",0.82,0.78,0.82,0.75,0.85,0.804,"0.82
The prediction is high due to the very strong statistical evidence: an extremely low p-value (implied by F(1,30)=14.49) and a very large effect size (__p^2=.326). Although the small sample size (N=32) is a significant concern and suggests the effect size may be inflated, the signal is so strong that a true effect is highly likely to be detected in a replication. The finding's nature as a plausible extension of a previously established effect further bolsters this confidence.
---
0.78
The reported F-statistic yields a p-value less than .001 and a very large effect size (__p^2=0.326), both of which are strong predictors of a successful replication. This confidence is tempered by the very small sample size (N=32), which increases the risk that the reported effect size is inflated. However, the sheer strength of the initial evidence suggests the effect is likely real and would be detected again, even if smaller in magnitude.
---
0.82
The reported effect size (ηp² = .326) is exceptionally large and the corresponding p-value is very low (p < .001), which are strong indicators of a robust finding. While the small sample size (N=32) is a significant weakness that increases the risk of an overestimated effect, the sheer magnitude of the effect makes it highly likely to be detected in a replication. The study's reliance on coding qualitative data introduces some methodological subjectivity, but this is a common procedure in cognitive psychology and the strength of the statistical result suggests the underlying phenomenon is real.
---
0.75
The first author's high citation count suggests an experienced researcher, and the statistical evidence is very strong, with a large effect size (ηp²=0.326) and a highly significant p-value (p<.001, derived from the F‑statistic). The main weakness is the very small sample size (N=32), which can produce inflated effect size estimates and introduces uncertainty. However, the magnitude of the reported effect is large enough that it would likely still be detected in a well-powered replication.
---
0.85
This prediction is high due to the very large reported effect size (ηp²= 0.326) and the highly significant p‑value (the F-statistic corresponds to p < .001), which are the strongest predictors of replication. Although the sample size (N=32) is small, the immense effect size suggests the finding is robust enough to be detected again. Furthermore, the study extends a well-replicated finding in cognitive aging, increasing its a priori likelihood."

The reported p-value is strong (p≈.003, inferred from the t-statistic) for a medium-sized effect (d=.57), which suggests the finding is likely real. However, the small sample size (N=32) is a significant weakness, as it can produce unstable and inflated effect size estimates, posing a non-trivial risk to replication. The simple analysis (t-test) is a positive factor, reducing concerns about analytical flexibility and errors.
---
0.68
The prediction is based on the strong statistical evidence; a t-test with t(31) = 3.23 yields a p-value of approximately .003, which strongly favors replication. However, this confidence is tempered by the small sample size (N=32), which increases the risk that the original finding was a chance result or that its effect size is inflated. The simple analysis (t-test) and the plausible, theory-driven nature of the finding provide some support, but the small sample remains a significant concern.
---
0.75
The analysis is a simple dependent t-test, which limits analytic flexibility and increases confidence in the finding. The reported statistics are strong, with a medium effect size (d = 0.571) and a low p-value (p ≈ .003, calculated from the t-statistic), suggesting a robust effect. However, the small sample size (N=32) is a significant weakness, as it can lead to inflated effect size estimates and increases the risk of a chance finding, tempering the overall likelihood of a successful replication.
---
0.72
The reported statistics provide strong evidence for the effect, with a medium-to-large effect size (d = .571) and a very low p-value (p ≈ .003, calculated from the t‑statistic), both of which strongly predict replication. While the small sample size (N=32) is a notable weakness that increases the risk of an overestimated effect, this is counterbalanced by the finding's statistical strength and the use of a simple, standard analysis. The first author’s citation count is modest and does not strongly influence the prediction.
---
0.62
The study reports a strong p-value (corresponding to the t-statistic of 3.23), and the analysis is a simple, standard t-test, which are positive indicators for replication. However, the very small sample size (N=32) is a major concern, as it can lead to inflated effect size estimates and unstable results. The subfield (developmental/social) and the use of a hard-to-test population (young children) also add a degree of uncertainty, leading to a moderate prediction of success."

We recruited 428 participants from an Internet-based subject pool and asked them eight questions probing their real-world knowledge. Although people assume that their first guess about a matter of fact exhausts the best information available to them, a forced second guess contributes additional information, such that the average of two guesses is better than either guess alone. This observed benefit of averaging multiple responses from the same person suggests that responses made by a subject are sampled from an internal probability distribution, rather than deterministically selected on the basis of all the knowledge a subject has.

Key details:
- Sample size: 173
- Analysis type (e.g. rm ANOVA, mixed ANOVA, regression, t‑test): dependent samples t-test
- Test statistic: t(172) = 3.94
- Reported p‑value: <.01
- Effect size (e.g. Cohen’s d, r): d = 0.47
- First author’s citation count: 2785
- Subfield: Cognitive, Social

Note:
First consider the subfield—some areas (e.g., social or developmental psychology) have historically shown lower replication rates—then adjust that judgment based on the specific study’s sample size, p-value, effect size, method complexity, and author citation count.",0.88,0.92,0.85,0.88,0.85,0.876,"0.88
This study has a high probability of replication due to its more-than-adequate sample size, solid p-value (<.01), and a very simple, transparent statistical analysis (dependent t-test). The reported medium effect size (d=0.47) was well-powered by the sample, and the finding itself is a plausible extension of a known, robust psychological phenomenon. These factors combine to suggest a robust and reproducible result.
---
0.92
The reported p-value of <.01 is strongly supported by the t-statistic, which actually corresponds to a much smaller p-value (~.0001), indicating a highly significant result. This strong signal, combined with an adequate sample size and a methodologically simple dependent t-test, suggests the effect is robust and not an artifact of analytical flexibility. The moderate effect size is substantial enough to be reliably detected in a well-powered replication.
---
0.85
The predicted replication success is high due to a combination of strong methodological features. The analysis is a dependent samples t‑test, a simple method with low analytic flexibility, which strongly favors replicability. This is bolstered by a respectable sample size (N=173) for a within-subjects design, a solid p‑value (p<.01), and a plausible small‑to‑medium effect size (d=0.47), suggesting the finding is robust and not an artifact of a borderline result.
---
0.88
This study has a high probability of successful replication due to its strong statistical evidence and simple design. The reported t‑statistic (3.94) corresponds to a p‑value much lower than the conservative p<.01 threshold, while the moderate effect size (d=0.47) is substantial. Furthermore, the analysis is a simple dependent t-test on an adequate sample, the cognitive paradigm is straightforward to implement, and the high citation count of the first author suggests methodological experience.
---
0.85
This study has a high probability of replication due to its strong statistical evidence and simple, transparent methodology. The p-value is well below the conventional threshold (p<.01), the effect size is moderate (d=0.47), and the sample size provides excellent statistical power for this straightforward within-subjects t-test. These factors suggest the finding is robust and not a statistical artifact."

This study has a very high probability of replication due to its extremely strong statistical evidence, including a very low p-value (<.00001) and a large effect size (ηp² = .308). Although the sample size (N=12) is small, this is a within-subjects cognitive experiment where each participant provides many data points, resulting in high statistical power as indicated by the large ANOVA degrees of freedom. The established author and the use of a standard, robust cognitive paradigm further increase confidence in the finding.
---
0.85
The extremely small p-value (<.00001) and very large effect size (__p^2 = .308) provide powerful evidence for a genuine effect, suggesting a high likelihood of replication. While the sample size of 12 is very small and a significant risk factor, this is partially offset by the within-subjects design common to cognitive psychology, a subfield with a stronger replication record. The sheer strength of the reported statistics indicates the finding is likely robust enough to replicate despite the small sample.
---
0.88
The very small sample size is a significant risk factor, but this is counteracted by an exceptionally strong signal—an extremely low p‑value and a very large effect size (ηp² = .308). The study also investigates a classic, robust phenomenon in cognitive psychology (the attentional blink), where large effects are expected and small-N designs can be reliable. Therefore, the strength of the reported effect suggests a high likelihood of replication success.
---
0.75
The prediction is high due to an extremely large effect size (ηp² = .308), a highly significant p‑value (<.00001), and a well‑established lead author studying a robust cognitive phenomenon. While the very small sample size (N=12) is a significant concern for generalizability, the sheer magnitude of the reported effect suggests it is likely to be detected in a replication attempt. The strong statistical evidence from the within‑subjects design likely overcomes the low number of participants.
---
0.88
The prediction is high due to the exceptionally strong statistical evidence; the p-value is extremely low (<.00001) and the effect size is very large (ηp² = .308), both of which are key predictors of replicability. Although the sample size is small, this is less concerning in a within-subjects cognitive paradigm studying a robust phenomenon like the attentional blink, where statistical power is high. The high citation count of the author further suggests the work is likely credible and sound."

This prediction is low primarily because the study's topic—the glucose model of ego depletion—comes from a subfield of social psychology with a well-documented history of failed replications. Furthermore, the reported statistics indicate a p-value (p≈.023) that is just below the p<.05 threshold and a small-to-medium effect size (__p^2=.045), a combination often associated with lower replicability due to potential publication bias or p-hacking. The moderate sample size is not large enough to overcome these significant concerns.

This study's central hypothesis, that self-control relies on a consumable resource like glucose, comes from the ""ego depletion"" literature, a subfield that has suffered from a well-documented replication crisis. The reported p-value (inferred from the F-statistic to be p≈.02) is only marginally significant, and the effect size is small (ηp² = .045). Such modest evidence for a theory that has largely failed to replicate suggests an independent replication attempt is very unlikely to succeed.
---
0.15
The study’s hypothesis, that self-control depletes blood glucose which can be restored with sugar, is from the subfield of ego depletion, which has famously low replication rates. This low prior probability of the effect is compounded by a p-value (p≈.023, inferred from the F‑statistic) that is close to the conventional significance threshold and a small effect size (ηp² = .045). The combination of a theoretically fragile hypothesis and statistically marginal evidence suggests a very low likelihood of successful replication.
---
0.15
While the author is established and the sample size is not trivial, the study's central hypothesis is rooted in the ego-depletion and glucose model of self-control, a theory that has performed very poorly in large-scale replication attempts. The p-value, derived from the F-statistic, is approximately .023, which is close enough to the .05 threshold to warrant skepticism, especially given the small effect size (ηp² = .045). These factors combined suggest a very low probability of successful replication.
---
0.15
The study tests the glucose model of self-control, a theory from social psychology that has famously failed to replicate in large-scale studies, making the premise highly questionable. This low prior probability is compounded by the reported statistics; the p-value is close to the significance threshold (p ≈ .023 from the F-statistic) and the effect size is small (ηp² = .045), indicating the original finding was not robust.

The predicted probability is low primarily due to the small sample size (N=31) and a p-value that is close to the threshold for significance (p<.05). Such findings are often statistically underpowered, leading to unstable estimates and a higher chance of the observed effect being inflated. While the analysis is simple, these statistical weaknesses suggest a direct replication is more likely than not to yield a null result.
---
0.25
The primary reason for the low replication likelihood is the combination of a small sample size (N=31) and a p-value reported as just below the conventional threshold of .05. This pattern suggests the study was underpowered and that the reported medium effect size (r=-.38) may be an overestimation, making the finding difficult to reproduce. Although the zero-order correlation analysis is simple and the author is well-cited, the weak statistical evidence is the most critical factor.

0.3
The probability is low due to the combination of a small sample size (N=31) and a p-value that is very close to the .05 threshold, which suggests the result is statistically fragile and may be an overestimation of the true effect. Although the zero-order correlation is a simple analysis type with little analytic flexibility, these primary statistical weaknesses make a successful replication unlikely.
---
0.42
While the first author’s high citation count suggests a well-established and potentially rigorous lab, this is outweighed by statistical weaknesses in the finding itself. The small sample size (N=31) and the p-value just meeting the <.05 threshold indicate that the result is not robust and has a high chance of being a false positive or an inflated effect estimate. The medium effect size (r = .38) is not large enough to overcome this statistical fragility.

This study has a low predicted probability of replication, primarily due to the combination of a small sample size (N=31) and a p-value just below the conventional significance threshold (p<.05). Such findings are often underpowered, leading to inflated effect size estimates and a higher likelihood of being false positives. While the simple correlational analysis is a positive factor, the low power and marginal significance in a subfield (social psychology) with historically mixed replication rates make a successful replication unlikely."

The extremely small sample size (N=12) is a major weakness that severely undermines confidence in the stability of the finding. While the reported p-value is strong and the analysis is simple, the associated effect size (d=3.25) is astronomically large and likely inflated due to the small sample. Such results are often subject to the ""winner's curse,"" meaning a replication is very likely to find a much smaller effect that may no longer be statistically significant.

0.25
Although the reported p-value is very strong, the study's extremely small sample size (N=12) makes this finding highly suspect. Such a small sample dramatically increases the chance of a false positive and leads to a massively inflated effect size estimate (d=3.25), which is not plausible for this type of research. A well-powered, independent replication would likely find a much smaller or null effect, making success improbable.

0.25
The primary drivers for this low replication probability are the extremely small sample size (N=12) and the implausibly large effect size (d=3.25). Such a massive effect in a tiny sample is a classic indicator of the ""winner's curse,"" where the reported effect is a dramatic overestimation of the true effect and is unlikely to be found again with the same magnitude. While the analysis is simple, the underlying fMRI methodology is complex and has known reproducibility challenges, further decreasing confidence in this finding.

0.35
The primary concern is the extremely small sample size (N=12), which drastically increases the risk of a false positive and produces unstable, likely inflated, results. Although the resulting p-value is very strong and the author is well-established, the implausibly large effect size (d=3.25) is a classic symptom of the ""winner's curse"" in an underpowered study. The complexity of fMRI research further compounds these issues, making the original finding’s stability and replicability questionable.

0.25
The extremely small sample size (n=12) is a primary concern, as it leads to unstable estimates and a high risk of false positives. While the reported p-value is very strong and the effect size is massive, such ""too good to be true"" results from tiny samples are often statistical artifacts that fail to replicate. The study's use of fMRI in social neuroscience also signals a lower probability of success, as these studies are complex, expensive, and have historically shown lower replication rates."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
The representation of visual information inside the focus of attention is more precise than the representation of information outside the focus of attention. We found that the visual system can compensate for the cost of withdrawing attention by pooling noisy local features and computing summary statistics. The location of an individual object is a local feature, whereas the center of mass of several objects (centroid) is a summary feature representing the mean object location. Three experiments showed that withdrawing attention degraded the representation of individual positions more than the representation of the centroid. It appears that information outside the focus of attention can be represented at an abstract level that lacks local detail, but nevertheless carries a precise statistical summary of the scene. The term ensemble features refers to a broad class of statistical summary features that we propose collectively make up the representation of information outside the focus of attention.

The extremely small sample size (N=8) makes the result highly unstable and prone to sampling error. While the reported effect size is very large, it is likely inflated due to the small sample, and the p-value of 0.028 is not strong evidence. The simple analysis and controlled cognitive paradigm are positives, but the statistical weaknesses suggest a modest probability of replication success.
---
0.35
The primary concerns are the extremely small sample size (N=8) and a p‑value (p=0.028) that is only narrowly significant, suggesting the original evidence is weak and statistically fragile. Although the reported effect size is very large, with such a small sample this estimate is likely inflated due to sampling error. While the simple analysis is a positive factor, these weaknesses create a substantial risk that a well‑powered replication would fail to produce a significant result.
---
0.35
The analysis is a simple dependent samples t-test, which reduces concerns about analytic flexibility. However, the extremely small sample size of 8 makes the results highly unstable and susceptible to noise. This small sample likely inflates the large reported effect size and, combined with a p-value just under the conventional significance threshold, suggests the finding may not be robust.
---
0.55
The prediction is tentative due to conflicting signals: the very small sample size (N=8) and borderline p-value (0.028) severely undermine confidence and suggest low statistical power. However, these risks are partly offset by the author's high citation count, the simple cognitive task and analysis, and a very large effect size, even if potentially inflated. The resulting estimate balances the weak statistical evidence for this specific finding against factors suggesting a genuine underlying phenomenon.
---
0.35
The prediction is low due to the extremely small sample size (N=8) and a p-value (0.028) that is close to the conventional significance threshold. While the reported effect size is very large, such estimates from small, low-power studies are often inflated and unlikely to be observed in a higher-powered replication. These factors indicating statistical fragility outweigh the positive signal of a simple analysis method."

This prediction is low primarily due to the extremely small sample size (N=36), which provides low statistical power and creates a high risk of both false positives and inflated effect size estimates. Although the reported effect size is large (ηp² = 0.147), such a large effect found in a small sample is often a statistical artifact and unlikely to be observed in a well‑powered replication. The calculated p‑value (from the F‑statistic) is approximately 0.02, which is close to the conventional threshold for significance and further suggests the finding may not be robust.
---
0.35
Although the reported p-value (p≈.02, inferred from the F‑statistic) is statistically significant, this evidence is substantially weakened by the study's extremely small sample size (N=36). Such a small sample provides low statistical power, meaning the large reported effect size is likely inflated and the result may not be stable. Social psychology studies with p-values close to the .05 threshold and very small samples have historically shown low rates of successful replication.
---
0.25
The prediction is low primarily due to the very small sample size (N=36), which provides low statistical power and increases the risk that the finding is a false positive or that the large effect size is highly inflated. Furthermore, the inferred p-value (p≈.02) is not highly compelling, and the study is in social psychology, a subfield where findings involving subtle experimental manipulations have historically shown low replicability. The ANOVA analysis is simple, but this positive factor is heavily outweighed by the multiple indicators of low statistical robustness.
---
0.15
This study has a very low probability of successful replication. The primary reasons are the extremely small sample size (N=36), which is highly underpowered for an ANOVA design, and the correspondingly large but likely inflated effect size (__p^2 = 0.147). The reported p-value, while significant, is not highly robust (p≈.02 based on the F-statistic), increasing the chance of a false positive, and the study's subfield (social psychology) and manipulation type are known to face replication challenges.
---
0.15
This prediction is low due to a combination of major risk factors. The study is in social psychology, a subfield with historically lower replication rates, and uses a very small sample size (N=36), which drastically increases the chance of a false positive and inflates the observed effect size. The resulting p-value, while statistically significant (p ≈ .02), is not highly compelling and falls into a range that has been shown to replicate less often."

In this study, we tested whether implied motion is represented by the same direction-selective signals involved in the perception of real motion. We made use of the motion aftereffect, a visual motion illusion. Three experiments showed that viewing a series of static photographs with implied motion in a particular direction produced motion aftereffects in the opposite direction, as assessed with real-motion test probes. The transfer of adaptation from motion depicted in photographs to real motion demonstrates that the perception of implied motion activates direction-selective circuits that are also involved in processing real motion.

This study has a very high probability of replication due to its extremely low p-value and large effect size, which are two of the strongest predictors of success. The use of a simple paired t-test and a powerful within-subjects design for a perceptual phenomenon also inspires confidence. While the sample size is modest, the strength of the statistical evidence suggests the underlying effect is robust and would likely be detected again.

0.92
The extremely low p-value provides very strong evidence, and this is corroborated by a large effect size (d = -0.94) and a powerful within-subjects design using a simple paired t-test. Although the sample size is modest, the strength and clarity of the signal suggest the effect is robust and highly likely to replicate. The study's focus on a basic perceptual phenomenon, which tends to be more reliable than complex social effects, further increases this confidence.
---
0.92
This study has a very high probability of replication due to a confluence of positive indicators. The reported p-value is extremely low and the effect size is large, both of which are strong predictors of a robust and replicable finding. The statistical analysis is a simple paired t-test, which offers little analytic flexibility, and the study is in cognitive psychology, a field that tends to have higher replication rates for perceptual phenomena.
---
0.92
This study has a very high probability of replication due to the convergence of multiple positive signals. The reported p-value is extremely small (p < .0001) and the effect size is large (d = -0.94), which are the strongest predictors of success. These results are bolstered by a simple, transparent analysis (paired t‑test) and a research topic in cognitive perception, a subfield with generally robust effects; additionally, the high author citation count suggests methodological expertise.
---
0.92
The prediction is high due to the exceptionally low p‑value and large effect size (Cohen’s d = -0.94), which are strong indicators of a robust finding. This confidence is further supported by the study's basis in cognitive perception—a subfield with historically higher replication rates—and the use of a simple, powerful within‑subjects design. While the sample size is modest, it is likely sufficient to reliably detect an effect of this magnitude."

This prediction is low due to the extremely small sample size (N=28), which provides low statistical power and produces unstable estimates. Furthermore, the test statistic corresponds to a p-value of approximately .051, which is not statistically significant by conventional standards, and the large effect size is likely inflated. Although the author is well-established, the combination of a tiny sample, borderline p-value, and a complex interaction effect makes a successful replication highly improbable.
---
0.25
The reported F-statistic corresponds to a p-value of approximately .051, which provides only marginal evidence against the null hypothesis. This weak signal, combined with a very small sample size (N=28) for a complex mixed ANOVA design, suggests the result may not be robust and has a high risk of being a false positive. Although the reported effect size is large, it is likely inflated due to the small sample, making a successful replication improbable.
---
0.15
The likelihood of successful replication is very low due to several converging factors. The study has an extremely small sample size (N=28), yielding low statistical power, and the test statistic corresponds to a p-value just barely below the conventional .05 threshold. Although the reported effect size is large, such estimates are often highly inflated in underpowered studies, and the complex interaction finding from a mixed ANOVA is inherently more difficult to reproduce than a simple main effect.
---
0.15
The study's primary weakness is its extremely low statistical power, stemming from a very small sample (N=28) and a reported test statistic (F(1, 26) = 4.17) that corresponds to a p-value of .051, which fails to meet the conventional threshold for significance. While the author is well-established and the reported effect size is large, this effect is likely an overestimate due to the small sample, and the complex interaction effect it describes is inherently difficult to replicate. The combination of a marginal p-value and low power makes a successful replication highly unlikely.
---
0.15
The prediction is low due to the extremely small sample size (N=28), which is inadequate for a complex mixed ANOVA and likely produced an inflated effect size. Furthermore, the reported F-statistic is not statistically significant by conventional standards (p≈.051), suggesting the original evidence was very weak. Such findings, particularly complex interactions in social psychology, are often difficult to replicate in larger, more definitive studies."

Whereas the association hypothesis predicted that the Black individual would be looked at more than the available White discussants in both conditions, the social-referencing hypothesis predicted this response only in the headphones-on condition, when he could hear the remark and have a potentially informative reaction. From a cognitive perspective, the results reveal that participants simultaneously attend to what is said, who can hear what is said, the social identity of the listeners, and the possible reactions of the listeners, corroborating recent findings that eye movements are influenced by a range of subtle linguistic and interpersonal factors. From a social perspective, the finding that the reactions of minority-group members are sought out by observers raises important questions about the function of this behavior.

First consider the subfield—some areas (e.g., social or developmental psychology) have historically shown lower replication rates—then adjust that judgment based on the specific study’s sample size, p-value, effect size, method complexity, and author citation count.",0.35,0.42,0.42,0.42,0.28,0.378,"0.35
The extremely small sample size (n=25) is a major weakness, providing low statistical power and likely leading to an inflated effect size estimate. While the reported p‑value is strong (<.005), this finding is a complex interaction effect uncovered by a mixed ANOVA in social psychology, a combination of factors that tends to reduce replicability. The subtlety of the social eye‑tracking phenomenon itself may also make the effect difficult to reliably reproduce.

0.42
Although the reported p-value is strong (p < .005), the very small sample size (N=25) is a major risk factor for replication failure. Such a small sample can produce spuriously significant results and leads to a high probability that the large reported effect size (__p^2 = .18) is substantially inflated. The weakness of the sample size, a critical foundation for statistical inference, outweighs the strength of the reported p-value.
---
0.42
This study presents conflicting indicators for replicability. The extremely small sample size (N=25) and the use of a complex mixed ANOVA on eye-tracking data are significant risk factors, as underpowered studies can produce inflated effect sizes and are more susceptible to spurious findings. While the reported p-value is strong (<.005) and the effect size is large (__p^2 = .18), these impressive metrics are less trustworthy given the profound weakness of the sample size, making a successful replication less than likely.
---
0.42
The primary concern is the very small sample size (N=25), which yields unstable estimates and significantly reduces replication likelihood. While the reported p-value is strong (<.005) and the effect size is large (ηp² = .18), these metrics are less reliable and likely inflated in underpowered studies. The complexity of the eye-tracking method and the subtle social-cognitive phenomenon also introduce uncertainty.
---
0.28
The prediction is low due to the combination of a very small sample size (N=25) and a very large reported effect size (__p^2 = .18), which suggests the original finding may be inflated and difficult to reproduce. Although the p-value is strong, studies in social psychology with small samples and ""surprising"" results have historically shown low rates of successful replication. The complexity of the eye-tracking method and mixed-effects model also introduces potential challenges for a direct replication."

The study's primary weakness is its very small sample size (N=24), which produces a p-value that, while significant, is not overwhelmingly so. However, this is strongly counterbalanced by a very large effect size (ηp² = .20) found using a powerful repeated-measures design, which is well-suited for detecting robust phenomena in cognitive psychology. The sheer magnitude of the effect suggests the finding is real and likely to replicate, even if a replication finds a somewhat smaller effect size.
---
0.40
The reported p-value, calculated from the F-statistic, is approximately .025; this result is statistically significant but not highly robust, as it lies close to the conventional .05 threshold. While the reported effect size is very large (ηp² = .20), it was observed in a very small sample (N=24), which increases the risk that both the p-value and the effect size are the result of sampling error. The combination of a small sample and a marginal p-value substantially lowers the confidence in a successful replication.
---
0.72
Although the large effect size (ηp² = .20) and within-subjects cognitive paradigm suggest a robust effect, the study's statistical evidence is weak due to a very small sample size (N=24) and marginal significance (p≈.025). These factors suggest the reported effect is inflated, but the underlying phenomenon is likely real and substantial enough to be successfully replicated.
---
0.45
The prediction is low primarily due to the very small sample size (N=24) and a p-value (calculated as p≈.025 from the F-statistic) that is close to the .05 threshold, suggesting the result may not be robust. While the high author citation count and powerful within-subjects design are positive indicators, the small sample means the large reported effect size is likely inflated and could be difficult to replicate.
---
0.75
This prediction is moderately high due to a powerful within-subjects design and a very large reported effect size (ηp² = .20), both strong positive predictors for a core cognitive psychology finding. However, the very small sample size (n=24) and a p-value that is significant but not highly convincing (p≈.025 based on the F‑statistic) introduce considerable uncertainty and suggest the reported effect size may be inflated. Overall, the strength of the experimental design and effect magnitude suggest a good chance of replication success."

The study's primary weakness is the combination of a small sample size (N=119) and a small effect size (pr=.21). Small effects require much larger samples to produce stable and reliable estimates, making these results susceptible to sampling error and less likely to replicate. While the reported p-value is significant and the analysis is straightforward, the low statistical power inherent in this design makes a successful replication improbable.
---
0.40
The reported `prep` of .92 corresponds to a p-value of approximately .02; while statistically significant, this is not a highly robust result and falls into a range with historically lower replication rates. This marginal p-value is paired with a small effect size (pr = .21) and a modest sample size (N = 119), increasing the likelihood that the original finding was an overestimate or a Type I error. Although the core analysis is simple, the subfield (social psychology) has had a mixed record of reproducibility for these types of correlational survey studies, suggesting a cautious forecast is warranted.
---
0.38
This prediction is low due to the combination of a small sample size (N=119) and a small effect size (pr=.21), which makes the finding susceptible to sampling error and likely inflates the true effect. The reported `prep` value is an outdated and overly optimistic substitute for a conventional p‑value (which is likely just under .05), a range where replication rates are often poor. While the partial correlation analysis is simple, the construction of the key variables from 52 items and the additional mediation models introduce analytical flexibility that lowers confidence in the result.
---
0.62
The highly-cited author and strong reported evidence (prep = .92, which corresponds to p ≈ .01) suggest a replicable finding. However, this is counteracted by a significant risk factor: the study has low statistical power due to its small sample size (N=119) for detecting a small effect size (pr=.21). Such underpowered studies can produce inflated effect estimates, making a successful replication less certain.
---
0.35
This prediction is low due to the combination of a small sample size (N=119) and a small effect size (pr = .21), which indicates the study was underpowered and at higher risk of being a false positive or an overestimated effect. While the author is well-cited and the p-value is technically significant, these statistical weaknesses, combined with the social psychology subfield's historically lower replication rates, make a successful replication unlikely."

Days later, both implicit and explicit evaluations of the original individuals generalized to the new individuals. The results suggest that associative links (e.g., shared group membership) are sufficient for implicit attitude generalization, but deliberative logic (e.g., individual group members are not necessarily the same) can reduce explicit generalization by association. When knowledge distinguishing who did what is unavailable, such as after forgetting, associative knowledge provides the basis of explicit evaluation.

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
People are able to explicitly resist using knowledge about one person to evaluate another person from the same group. After learning about positive and negative behaviors performed by one individual from each of two different groups, participants were introduced briefly to new individuals from the groups. Implicit evaluations of the original individuals readily generalized to the new individuals; explicitly, participants resisted such generalization. Days later, both implicit and explicit evaluations of the original individuals generalized to the new individuals. The results suggest that associative links (e.g., shared group membership) are sufficient for implicit attitude generalization, but deliberative logic (e.g., individual group members are not necessarily the same) can reduce explicit generalization by association. When knowledge distinguishing who did what is unavailable, such as after forgetting, associative knowledge provides the basis of explicit evaluation. We conclude that a simple association linking one individual to another can produce implicit attitude generalization immediately and explicit attitude generalization eventually.

Note:
First consider the subfield—some areas (e.g., social or developmental psychology) have historically shown lower replication rates—then adjust that judgment based on the specific study’s sample size, p-value, effect size, method complexity, and author citation count.",0.15,0.12,0.95,0.15,0.95,0.464,"0.15
The reported effect size is virtually zero (d = ‑0.004) and the test statistic is non‑significant (t = ‑0.11), indicating a null result. While the large sample size (N=564) provides a precise estimate, it increases our confidence that the true effect is indeed null, making it very unlikely a replication would find a significant effect. This conclusion is directly supported by the very low reported `prep` value, which estimates the probability of replicating an effect.
---
0.12
The reported `prep` of .18, an older metric for estimating replication probability, is already very low, but the other statistics are even more conclusive. The test statistic (t = -0.11) and effect size (d = -0.004) are both functionally zero, indicating a clear null finding. The very large sample size (N=564) provides high precision for this null effect, making it highly probable that the true effect is negligible and thus extremely unlikely to yield a significant result in a replication attempt.
---
0.95
The reported statistical test is a simple t-test, which limits analytic flexibility. Crucially, the reported effect size is virtually zero (d = -0.004) and the corresponding p-value is extremely high, indicating a clear null result. Given the very large sample size, this null finding is estimated with high precision, making it very likely that an independent replication would also find a non-significant result and thus successfully replicate the original finding.
---
0.15
While the first author is well-cited and the sample size is large, these positive indicators are entirely overshadowed by the statistical results. The reported effect size (d = -0.004) and test statistic (t = -0.11) are both extremely close to zero, providing strong evidence for a null effect. A replication is therefore highly unlikely to achieve a statistically significant result, and the authors’ own reported `prep` value of .18 suggests a very low probability of replication success.
---
0.95
The very large sample size provides high statistical power and a precise estimate of the effect. The reported statistics, including an effect size (d) near zero and a t-statistic close to zero, offer strong evidence for a null effect. A successful replication of this finding would also yield a null result, which is highly probable given the original study's precision and clarity on this specific test."

The extremely small sample size (N=30) is a major weakness, as it provides low statistical power and leads to unstable estimates. Consequently, the reported p‑value is not very convincing and the very large effect size is likely inflated. This type of subtle behavioral priming study in social psychology has also historically demonstrated low rates of successful replication.
---
0.25
The reported p-value is strong (<.01), but it was obtained from a very small sample (N=30), which raises concerns about the stability and accuracy of the large reported effect size. Furthermore, the study involves a subtle behavioral priming manipulation in social psychology, a combination that has historically proven difficult to replicate robustly. The small sample size is the most significant factor, substantially increasing the likelihood that the original finding was a false positive or an overestimation.
---
0.25
The very small sample size (N=30) and the study's basis in social priming—a subfield with a history of replication challenges—are significant red flags. Although the reported effect size is large (d=.88), such findings from underpowered studies are often inflated and are highly variable upon replication. Therefore, despite the simple statistical analysis and significant p-value, the core methodological and subfield characteristics suggest a low likelihood of a successful independent replication.
---
0.15
Despite the first author’s high citation count and the strong reported effect size (d=.88), the study’s extremely small sample size (N=30) suggests the result is likely an unstable overestimation. Conceptual priming manipulations in social psychology have a well-documented history of poor replicability, and the study’s design relies on a subtle intervention (reading a text) to influence a complex behavior (cheating). These factors combine to suggest a low probability of successful replication.
---
0.15
The primary reasons for the low predicted replication success are the very small sample size (N=30) and the correspondingly large, likely-inflated effect size (d=0.88). While the reported p-value is significant, findings from underpowered studies in social psychology are often not robust. A subtle manipulation like reading a text is unlikely to produce such a large and consistent behavioral effect in a larger, more definitive replication attempt."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
Previous research has shown that the detectability of a local change in a visual image is essentially independent of the complexity of the image when the interstimulus interval (ISI) is very short, but is limited by a low-capacity memory system when the ISI exceeds 100 ms. In the study reported here, listeners made same/different judgments on pairs of successive ""chords"" (sums of pure tones with random frequencies). The change to be detected was always a frequency shift in one of the tones, and which tone would change was unpredictable. Performance worsened as the number of tones increased, but this effect was not larger for 2-s ISIs than for 0-ms ISIs. Similar results were obtained when a chord was followed by a single tone that had to be judged as higher or lower than the closest component of the chord. Overall, our data suggest that change detection is based on different mechanisms in audition and vision.

The extremely small sample size of four participants is the most critical weakness, making the results highly likely to be idiosyncratic and unstable. Although the reported p-value is low and the effect size is massive, these metrics are unreliable with such a tiny sample and are likely to be heavily inflated. Consequently, despite the finding being in a field (cognitive perception) where large effects are plausible, the statistical evidence is far too weak to expect a successful replication.
---
0.25
The reported p-value is very low (p=.005) and the effect size is large (η² = .74), which would normally suggest a high likelihood of replication. However, these metrics are completely undermined by the extremely small sample size of only four participants. Such a tiny sample yields highly unstable estimates, meaning the significant result is likely due to chance or a massive overestimation of the true effect, and is therefore unlikely to replicate in a new sample.
---
0.75
While the sample size of four is extremely small and a major risk factor, the reported effect size is exceptionally large (η² = .74) with a correspondingly low p-value (p=.005). Such strong effects are common in cognitive psychophysics and are often robust enough to be reliably detected. Therefore, the sheer magnitude of the finding suggests a high likelihood of successful replication, overpowering the concern about the small sample.
---
0.78
This prediction is high primarily due to the exceptionally large reported effect size (η² = .74) and correspondingly low p-value (p = .005), which are strong indicators of a robust finding. While the sample size of four is a significant concern for generalizability, a direct replication is likely to succeed because such a large effect should be easily detectable even with a small sample. The experienced author and the controlled, psychophysical nature of the task in cognitive psychology also slightly increase confidence in the result.
---
0.35
Although the reported p-value is low and the effect size is very large, which are positive indicators, the extremely small sample size of four participants makes this finding highly suspect. Such a small sample yields very unstable estimates, meaning the reported effect is likely a substantial overestimation and may not be robust. Therefore, despite the strong statistics, the result has a low probability of replicating in a new, independent sample."

While the reported statistics (a low p-value inferred from prep and a large effect size) appear strong, the moderate sample size (N=84) makes these estimates potentially unstable and inflated. More critically, the study uses a social/embodied priming manipulation, a research paradigm that has a well-documented history of replication failures. The high risk associated with this specific subfield and study type substantially lowers the probability of a successful independent replication.
---
0.21
While the reported p-value (a `p_rep` of .95 corresponds to p ≈ .008) and large effect size seem promising, the study has several features associated with low replicability. The sample size of 84 for a three-group design is small, making the study underpowered and the large effect likely an overestimation. Furthermore, the paradigm is a classic social/cognitive priming study, a research area that has historically suffered from major replication failures.
---
0.25
The study's low sample size (N=84 for 3 groups) yields low statistical power, making the results less reliable and increasing the chance of a false positive. While the p-value is strong and the effect size is large, such findings are common in underpowered studies due to effect-size inflation. The subfield of social priming, to which this study belongs, has a well-documented history of replication failures for similar subtle manipulations, further reducing confidence in the result.

0.32
While the reported p-value is strong (p≈.009, based on the F-statistic) and the effect size is large, these results may be unreliable due to the small sample size. The study's paradigm, a form of social priming, comes from a subfield that has historically suffered from low replication rates, making the extraordinary claim less plausible. Therefore, despite the positive surface-level statistics and the author's experience, the contextual factors suggest a low probability of successful replication.

0.25
This study's subfield, social priming, has a well-documented history of low replication rates. Although the reported effect size is large and the p-value is significant, the small sample size (N=84) suggests these statistics may be inflated and increases the risk that the original finding was a false positive. The surprising and abstract nature of the causal claim—that plotting points on a graph affects deep-seated emotions—further reduces the predicted likelihood of a successful replication."

These findings support a functional view of emotion regulation, and demonstrate that in certain contexts, individuals may choose to experience emotions that are instrumental, despite short-term hedonic costs.

Key details:
- Sample size: 82
- Analysis type (e.g. rm ANOVA, mixed ANOVA, regression, t‑test): RM ANOVA
- Test statistic: F(2, 162) = 192.89
- Reported p‑value: <.001
- Effect size (e.g. Cohen’s d, r): X
- First author’s citation count: 2114
- Subfield: Cognitive, Social

Note:
First consider the subfield—some areas (e.g., social or developmental psychology) have historically shown lower replication rates—then adjust that judgment based on the specific study’s sample size, p-value, effect size, method complexity, and author citation count.",0.85,0.92,0.85,0.92,0.85,0.878,"0.85
The sample size of 82 is only moderate, which slightly tempers confidence. However, this is strongly counteracted by the extremely large F-statistic and very low p-value (<.001), which imply a massive and easily detectable effect. Given such robust statistical evidence from a standard analysis by an experienced author, the finding is highly likely to replicate successfully.
---
0.92
The extremely low p-value (p < .001) and the massive corresponding F-statistic (F = 192.89) are the strongest predictors of success, suggesting a very large and robust effect that is unlikely to be a statistical artifact. Although the sample size of 82 is only moderate, it is more than sufficient to reliably detect an effect of this magnitude. The use of a standard analysis (RM ANOVA) in a mainstream subfield further bolsters confidence in a successful replication.
---
0.85
The primary predictor of high replicability is the extremely strong statistical evidence; the reported F‑value is massive (F=192.89) and the p‑value is very low (p<.001), implying a very large effect size. While the sample size (N=82) is not large, it is sufficient to reliably detect an effect of this magnitude, especially in a within-subjects design (RM ANOVA). Although the effect is unusually strong for social psychology, its statistical power suggests a robust finding that is very likely to replicate successfully.
---
0.92
The primary drivers of this high replication estimate are the extremely small p-value (<.001) and the massive associated F-statistic, which imply a very large and robust effect that should be readily detectable even with a moderate sample size. The experienced first author adds modest confidence in the methodology, while the use of a standard, powerful within-subjects design (RM ANOVA) further suggests the finding is likely reliable. The effect is conceptually plausible and was tested in a controlled laboratory experiment, which generally have higher replication rates.
---
0.85
The statistical evidence for this finding is overwhelmingly strong. The reported F-value is extremely large and the p-value is very low (<.001), indicating a massive and highly significant effect that is unlikely to be a false positive. While social psychology studies can be sensitive to context and have shown lower replication rates historically, an effect of this magnitude should be robust enough to replicate easily, even with a modest sample of 82 participants."

The probability is low primarily due to the very small sample size (N=57), which provides insufficient statistical power and suggests the large reported effect size (η²=.12) is likely inflated. Although the p‑value is significant (p=0.01), it is not overwhelmingly convincing and falls in a range with lower replication success. Most importantly, a critical inconsistency between the sample size and the F-test's degrees of freedom raises serious concerns about the accuracy and reliability of the original analysis.
---
0.38
The reported p-value of 0.01 provides moderate evidence, but this is substantially weakened by the very small sample size (N=57) for a relatively complex mixed ANOVA design. Small samples can lead to unstable and inflated effect sizes (here, a large η² = .12), meaning this finding may be a ""winner's curse"" result that is difficult to replicate. While the first author is highly cited, the statistical weakness of the original evidence makes a successful replication less probable.
---
0.35
The primary concerns for replicability are the very small sample size (N=57) and the use of a complex mixed ANOVA, which can introduce analytic flexibility. While the reported effect size is large, such estimates are often inflated in small, underpowered studies, and the p-value of .01 is not low enough to overcome these strong negative indicators. The study's origin in social psychology, a subfield with a history of replication challenges, also lowers confidence.

0.38
Although the first author is highly cited, suggesting experience, the study has a significant risk of replication failure. The primary concerns are the very small sample size (N=57) and the social psychology subfield, which together increase the likelihood of an overestimated effect size and a false-positive finding. While the p-value of .01 and large effect size seem strong, these figures are less reliable in the context of a low-powered design.
---
0.35
This prediction is low primarily due to the social psychology subfield's historical replication rates and the study's small sample size (N=57), which is insufficient for a mixed ANOVA and suggests the finding may be unstable. While the reported p-value is significant (p=.01) and the effect size is large (η² =.12), results from underpowered studies are often inflated and have a lower probability of successful replication. The high author citation count is a positive indicator but does not outweigh the statistical weaknesses of this specific finding."

The reported statistical evidence for the main finding is exceptionally strong, characterized by a massive effect size (ηp^2 = .59) and an extremely significant p‑value (p=0, F=109.74). The sample size of 240 is quite good for this type of experimental research, providing sufficient power to confidently detect such a large effect. Given this combination of a very large and highly significant effect found in a well-powered study, the finding is very likely to be robust and replicate successfully.
---
0.95
The reported p-value is exceptionally low and the effect size (__p^2 = .59) is massive, indicating a very robust finding that should be easily detectable again. This strong statistical evidence is supported by a large sample size for a lab experiment (N=240) and a simple, standard analysis (t-test/ANOVA). The finding itself, a strong preference for in-group cooperation over out-group harm in a behavioral game, is also psychologically plausible, further boosting the likelihood of a successful replication.
---
0.92
The reported effect size (__p^2 = .59) is exceptionally large, and the associated p-value and F-statistic (F(1, 76) = 109.74) provide overwhelming statistical evidence for the finding. Combined with a robust sample size (N=240) and a simple statistical analysis (t-test/ANOVA), the study's main result appears highly robust. Although social psychology studies can have mixed replication success, the sheer magnitude of this effect suggests it is very likely to replicate.
---
0.92
The prediction is very high due to overwhelmingly strong statistical evidence. The reported p-value is effectively zero and the effect size (ηp^2 = .59) is exceptionally large, suggesting a very robust phenomenon that should be easily detected again. This conclusion is further supported by the large sample size for a lab experiment and the use of a simple, standard statistical analysis, reducing the risk of error or analytical complexity hindering reproducibility.

0.88
The prediction is high due to the exceptionally strong statistical evidence; the reported p-value is effectively zero and the effect size (ηp^2 = .59) is massive, suggesting a very robust phenomenon. While social psychology studies can have lower replication rates and the introduction of a new paradigm creates some uncertainty, the large sample size and the sheer magnitude of the reported effect make it highly likely to be detected in a replication attempt."

The probability of a successful replication is low primarily due to the extremely small sample size of 15 participants. Although the reported effect size is massive (d=1.71) and the p‑value is low, these metrics are unreliable and likely inflated in underpowered studies. The simple analysis is a positive factor, but it cannot overcome the high risk that the original finding was a false positive or a substantial overestimation of the true effect.
---
0.42
Although the reported p-value is low (p < .007) and the effect size is exceptionally large, the study’s extremely small sample size (N=15) is a major weakness that casts doubt on the result’s stability. Such a small sample produces highly unreliable estimates, and the massive effect size is likely inflated due to random sampling error. A replication attempt with a more appropriately sized sample would probably find a much smaller, and potentially non-significant, effect.
---
0.35
The prediction is low primarily due to the extremely small sample size (N=15), which makes the findings highly susceptible to sampling error and low statistical power. While the reported p-value is low and the t‑test is a simple analysis, the massive effect size (d=1.71) is likely an overestimation typical of underpowered studies. A well-powered replication would probably find a much smaller effect that may not be statistically significant.
---
0.35
This prediction is low primarily due to the very small sample size (N=15) and the consequently suspect, extremely large effect size (d=1.71). While the reported p-value is strong (<.007) and the analysis is simple, findings from such underpowered studies are often inflated by sampling error and have a low probability of replicating. The author's moderate citation count does not substantially mitigate these primary concerns.

0.35
The very small sample size (N=15) is a major concern, as it often leads to unstable and inflated effect size estimates like the one reported (d=1.71). Although the p‑value is low and the analysis is simple, results from such underpowered studies are notoriously difficult to replicate successfully. The true effect is likely much smaller, if it exists at all, reducing the chances that a new study would find a significant result."

The prediction is low primarily because the study investigates an ovulatory shift hypothesis, a research area in evolutionary psychology with a well-documented history of replication failures. While the sample size is moderate and the p-value is significant, the finding relies on a complex interaction effect, which is inherently less robust and more susceptible to being a statistical artifact than a simple main effect. The combination of a controversial topic and a complex statistical finding makes a successful replication improbable.

0.32
Although the reported p-value of 0.008 suggests a robust finding, this is offset by several significant risk factors. The study tests a complex three-way interaction within evolutionary psychology, a subfield where similar findings linking hormone cycles to behavior have replicated poorly. The small-to-medium effect size, combined with the difficulty of accurately measuring fertility, further reduces confidence that this specific, nuanced effect would be reproduced.

0.15
This study has a very low probability of replication. The primary reason is that the ""ovulatory shift"" hypothesis in evolutionary social psychology has a well-documented history of failed replications. Furthermore, the key finding is a complex interaction with a small-to-medium effect size (f = 0.19), which is inherently less robust and more difficult to reproduce than a large main effect. These factors strongly outweigh the moderately supportive p-value and sample size.

Despite a statistically significant p-value, the probability of successful replication is very low primarily because this study tests an ovulatory shift hypothesis, a specific area of evolutionary social psychology with a well-documented history of failed replications. The relatively small effect size (f=0.19) and the reliance on a complex interaction effect further decrease confidence in the finding's robustness. These factors largely outweigh the experienced author and adequate sample size for the original report.

This study's subfield, evolutionary psychology, and specific topic, ovulatory shift effects on mate preference, have a well-documented history of failed replications. The central claim relies on a complex interaction effect, which is statistically less stable and harder to replicate than a simple main effect. Although the p-value is strong, the small-to-medium effect size (f = 0.19) suggests the finding is not robust and is at high risk of being a false positive or an overestimation."

Accordingly, we predicted that (a) partnered women should prefer attached men, because such men are more likely than single men to have pair-bonding qualities, and hence to be good replacement partners, and (b) this inclination should reverse when fertility rises, because attached men are less available for impromptu sex than single men. In this study, 208 women rated the attractiveness of men described as single or attached. As predicted, partnered women favored attached men at the low-fertility phases of the menstrual cycle, but preferred single men (if masculine, i.e., advertising good genetic quality) when conception risk was high.

Note:
First consider the subfield—some areas (e.g., social or developmental psychology) have historically shown lower replication rates—then adjust that judgment based on the specific study’s sample size, p-value, effect size, method complexity, and author citation count.",0.25,0.25,0.25,0.28,0.15,0.236,"0.25
The low probability reflects that this study tests an ""ovulatory shift"" hypothesis, an area of evolutionary psychology with a history of failed replications. Although the sample size is adequate and the p-value is significant, the effect size is small-to-medium, making the finding difficult to detect reliably. The complexity of the multi-way interaction also increases the chance that the original result was a statistical artifact or highly context-dependent.
---
0.25
While the reported p‑value of 0.008 provides some evidence against the null, the likelihood of replication is low due to several countervailing factors. The reported effect size is small (f = 0.19), and the study tests for a complex interaction effect, both of which suggest the finding may not be robust. Critically, research on mate preference shifts across the ovulatory cycle belongs to a subfield with a well-documented history of prominent replication failures.
---
0.25
The prediction is low primarily because the subfield—evolutionary psychology linking mate choice to the menstrual cycle—has a notably poor replication record. Furthermore, the study tests a complex interaction for a small effect size (f = 0.19), both of which are factors known to reduce replicability. While the sample size is decent and the p-value is not borderline, these positive indicators are insufficient to overcome the substantial concerns about the robustness of this specific research area.
---
0.28
The prediction is low primarily because the hypothesis—that mate preferences shift across the ovulatory cycle—comes from a subfield with a poor track record of replication. Furthermore, the reported effect size is small-to-medium and the finding is a complex interaction, which are both associated with lower replicability. While the p-value is significant (p = .008), this is not compelling enough to overcome the strong prior reasons for skepticism about the robustness of this specific effect.
---
0.15
This prediction is very low primarily because the subfield—evolutionary psychology focusing on ovulatory shifts—has a well-documented history of failed replications. While the sample size is moderate and the p-value is significant (p=.008), the reported small-to-medium effect size (f=0.19) and the complex interaction finding are characteristic of results that are difficult to reproduce. These factors suggest the original finding is likely a false positive or a substantial overestimate of a negligible true effect."

The reported p-value is very low and the effect size is exceptionally large, which would normally suggest a high chance of replication. However, the sample size is extremely small (N=14), which makes the findings highly susceptible to random error, drastically increases the chance of a false positive, and likely inflates the observed effect size. The severe statistical weakness of the small sample outweighs the strength of the reported results.

0.68
The reported p-value is very low (the F-statistic corresponds to p≈.002) and the effect size is extremely large (ηp² = .522), which are strong positive indicators for replication. However, these promising metrics are derived from a very small sample (N=14), which makes the effect size estimate highly imprecise and likely inflated. While the signal is strong enough to suggest an underlying effect is present, the low power of the original study introduces considerable uncertainty, tempering the overall likelihood of a successful replication.
---
0.40
Although the reported effect size is very large and the corresponding p-value is low, this evidence is drawn from an extremely small sample (N=14). Small samples produce unstable estimates and are prone to the ""winner's curse,"" meaning the reported effect is likely a substantial overestimation of the true effect. The weak statistical power of the original study undermines the strong headline numbers, making a successful replication unlikely.

0.72
This study has a very low p-value (p≈.002, derived from the F-statistic) and a massive effect size, which are strong positive predictors of replication. However, these impressive results come from an extremely small sample (N=14), making the effect estimate unreliable and likely inflated, which substantially lowers confidence. The well-controlled cognitive paradigm and the low author citation count are minor factors in this assessment.
---
0.65
This prediction balances strong statistical evidence against a key methodological weakness. The reported effect size is exceptionally large (ηp^2 = 0.522) and the corresponding p-value is very low, suggesting a robust phenomenon that should be easy to detect. However, the extremely small sample size (N=14) makes the result highly sensitive to sampling error and potential effect size inflation, introducing significant uncertainty about its stability."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
Theories of moral judgment have long emphasized reasoning and conscious thought while downplaying the role of intuitive and contextual influences. However, recent research has demonstrated that incidental feelings of disgust can influence moral judgments and make them more severe. This study involved two experiments demonstrating that the reverse effect can occur when the notion of physical purity is made salient, thus making moral judgments less severe. After having the cognitive concept of cleanliness activated (Experiment 1) or after physically cleansing themselves after experiencing disgust (Experiment 2), participants found certain moral actions to be less wrong than did participants who had not been exposed to a cleanliness manipulation. The findings support the idea that moral judgment can be driven by intuitive processes, rather than deliberate reasoning. One of those intuitions appears to be physical purity, because it has a strong connection to moral purity.

Key details:
- Sample size: 43
- Analysis type (e.g. rm ANOVA, mixed ANOVA, regression, t‑test): between ANOVA
- Test statistic: F(1, 41) = 7.81
- Reported p‑value: prep = .97
- Effect size (e.g. Cohen’s d, r): __p^2 = .16
- First author’s citation count: 1700
- Subfield: Cognitive, Social

Note:
First consider the subfield—some areas (e.g., social or developmental psychology) have historically shown lower replication rates—then adjust that judgment based on the specific study’s sample size, p-value, effect size, method complexity, and author citation count.",0.2,0.15,0.15,0.22,0.18,0.18,"0.2
The predicted probability is low primarily due to the very small sample size (N=43), which produces unstable estimates and suggests the large reported effect size (ηp² = .16) is likely inflated. Furthermore, the study's topic of social priming and embodied cognition falls within a subfield that has faced significant and well-documented replication challenges. These major risk factors strongly suggest a low likelihood of successful replication, despite the reported statistical significance.

0.15
While the reported p-value is strong and the effect size is large, the study's very small sample size (N=43) makes these findings highly suspect and likely inflated. Furthermore, this type of social priming research, which posits that subtle situational cues can powerfully influence behavior, has a well-documented history of failing to replicate. The combination of a small sample and an implausible effect from a subfield known for replication issues suggests a low probability of success.
---
0.15
This study has a very high risk of non-replication due to its extremely small sample size (N=43) for a between-subjects design, which makes the finding statistically fragile and the very large effect size (ηp² = .16) likely to be highly inflated. Furthermore, subtle priming effects in social psychology, especially those related to “moral cleansing,” have a well-established history of failing to replicate in larger, more rigorous studies. The combination of these factors suggests the original result was likely a false positive or a substantial overestimation of any true effect.
---
0.22
The predicted probability is very low despite the author's experience and a statistically significant result. The primary concerns are the very small sample size (N=43) for a between-subjects design and the study's focus on a subtle social priming effect, a research area with a poor replication history. Such underpowered studies often produce inflated effect sizes (ηp^2 = .16 here) and are less likely to yield the same results in a high-powered replication attempt.
---
0.18
The study's subfield (social psychology) and paradigm (conceptual priming) have historically low replication rates, casting initial doubt on the finding. This skepticism is amplified by the very small sample size (N=43) and an implausibly large effect size (ηp² = .16), which together suggest a high risk of being a false positive or a severely inflated effect. While the resulting p-value is nominally strong, it is insufficient to overcome these substantial methodological weaknesses."

Despite the extremely small sample size, which is a significant risk factor, the reported effect is exceptionally large (d=1.573) with a highly significant p-value (p<.001). Such powerful and consistent effects are plausible within cognitive perception research, where basic perceptual phenomena can produce uniform responses across participants. The strength of the reported evidence, combined with the simple analysis, suggests the finding is robust and likely to replicate.
---
0.88
The extremely small p-value (< .001) and very large effect size (d = 1.573) suggest a powerful and robust finding, which is the primary driver of this high prediction. While the sample size (N=8) is a significant concern, the study type—a basic perceptual experiment where effects are often large and consistent across individuals—makes it plausible that the effect is real and easily detectable. The simple analysis (t-test) and experienced author also lend confidence to the result's stability.
---
0.78
The reported effect size is massive (d=1.573) and the p-value is very low (<.001), suggesting a powerful and robust phenomenon, which increases the likelihood of replication. While the sample size of 8 is extremely small and a major concern, this risk is somewhat mitigated by the simplicity of the statistical analysis (a single sample t-test, which has low analytic flexibility) and the subfield (basic visual perception), where small-N designs are more common for strong, consistent effects. The combination of a huge effect and a simple test makes replication probable, though the small N introduces uncertainty about the true effect size.
---
0.88
The first author’s high citation count suggests experience and a lower prior probability of a fluke finding. Although the sample size is very small, this is strongly offset by the extremely low p-value and very large effect size, which suggest a powerful and consistent underlying phenomenon. Basic cognitive perception effects investigated with simple analyses are often robust, making replication success highly likely despite the small sample.
---
0.8
Although the sample size is extremely small, creating high uncertainty, the reported p-value is very low (<.001) and the effect size is massive. The study also concerns a basic cognitive perception phenomenon, which tend to be robust and have higher replication rates than other subfields. Therefore, despite the risk of an inflated effect size estimate, the signal appears strong enough that a successful replication is highly probable."

This study has a high likelihood of replication. The prediction is primarily driven by the large sample size for a country-level analysis (N=70) and the medium-to-large effect size (r=-0.43), which together produce a highly significant p-value. Additionally, the straightforward correlational analysis is easy to reproduce, and the finding itself—a methodological critique from a highly-cited author—is more plausible and less prone to subtle artifacts than many experimental results in social psychology.

This study has a high probability of replication due to its strong effect size (r = -0.43) and a respectable sample for a country-level analysis (N=70), which yields a highly significant p-value.

The prediction is high due to a confluence of positive factors. The study reports a medium-to-large effect size (r = -0.43) which, with a sample of 70 units, yields a very low p-value and indicates a statistically robust finding. This confidence is further bolstered by the first author’s very high citation count, suggesting extensive expertise, and the use of a simple and robust correlational analysis.

Although this study is in social psychology—a field with historically lower replication rates—it has several strong positive indicators. The reported effect size (r = -0.43) is substantial and the implied p-value is very low (p < .001), suggesting the result is unlikely to be a statistical fluke. While the sample of 70 is modest, the simple correlational analysis and the strength of the finding point towards a high probability of successful replication."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
Previous research has shown that dominant individuals frequently think in terms of dominance hierarchies, which typically invoke vertical metaphor (e.g., ""upper"" vs. ""lower"" class). Accordingly, we predicted that in spatial attention paradigms, such individuals would systematically favor the vertical dimension of space more than individuals low in dominance. This prediction was supported by two studies (total N= 96), which provided three tests involving two different spatial attention paradigms. In all cases, analyses controlling for speed of response to horizontal spatial probes revealed that more dominant individuals were faster than less dominant individuals to respond to probes along the vertical dimension of space. Such data support the metaphor-representation perspective, according to which people think in metaphoric terms, even in on-line processing tasks. These results have implications for understanding dominance and also indicate that conceptual metaphor is relevant to understanding the cognitive-processing basis of personality.

Note:
First consider the subfield—some areas (e.g., social or developmental psychology) have historically shown lower replication rates—then adjust that judgment based on the specific study’s sample size, p-value, effect size, method complexity, and author citation count.",0.28,0.35,0.25,0.28,0.25,0.282,"0.28
The small sample size (N=53) is a major concern, as it provides low statistical power and yields an imprecise estimate for the modest effect size (r=‑.31). The reported p‑value of <.05, rather than a precise value, suggests the result is not overwhelmingly strong and may be close to the significance threshold. While the analysis is simple, findings like these in social cognition are often sensitive to context and have shown mixed replicability, making a successful replication less likely.
---
0.35
The prediction is low due to the combination of a small sample size (N=53) and a p-value reported as just under the conventional significance threshold. While the effect size of r = -.31 is moderate, a finding from a small-sample study with a p-value close to .05 is often imprecise, likely an overestimate, and less likely to replicate successfully. The subfield of social cognition has also seen challenges in replicating subtle effects linking personality to cognitive-processing tasks.
---
0.25
This study has several indicators of low replicability. The sample size (N=53) is small for a correlation analysis, providing low statistical power to detect the modest effect size (r = -.31). Critically, the reported p-value is just under the conventional .05 threshold, which, combined with low power, suggests the result may be a type I error or that the effect size is substantially overestimated (the ""winner's curse"").
---
0.28
The primary concerns for replication are the small sample size (N=53) and the p-value being reported as just below the .05 threshold. This combination suggests low statistical power and increases the chance that the observed effect size (r = -.31) is an overestimation. Furthermore, conceptual metaphor or embodied cognition effects in social psychology often prove subtle and difficult to replicate reliably.
---
0.25
The small sample size (N=53) combined with a p-value just below the .05 threshold suggests the original study was underpowered and that the reported effect size (r=-.31) is likely an overestimation. Individual difference effects in social cognition are often noisy and require larger samples to detect reliably. A replication attempt with a similar sample would therefore have a low probability of finding a statistically significant result."

This study has a good chance of replicating due to its very large reported effect size (ηp² = .14) and use of a standard cognitive paradigm, which are strong positive indicators. However, confidence is tempered because the sample size of 40 is modest and the p-value (p ≈ .017, calculated from the F-statistic) is significant but not overwhelmingly strong. These factors suggest a genuine underlying effect that might nonetheless be susceptible to sampling error in a direct replication attempt.
---
0.88
The prediction is high due to the combination of a large reported effect size (ηp² = .14) and a solid p‑value (p ≈ .017, inferred from the F‑statistic). While the sample size (N=40) is moderate, it provided high statistical power for an effect of this magnitude in a standard within-subjects cognitive paradigm. The straightforward ANOVA and experienced author further increase confidence in the robustness of the finding.
---
0.81
The prediction is high due to the large reported effect size (ηp² = .14) and a correspondingly strong p‑value (p ≈ .017, derived from the F‑statistic), which suggests a robust phenomenon. While the sample size of 40 is modest by modern standards and could lead to an overestimated effect, the finding's strength combined with a simple ANOVA design and a classic cognitive paradigm increases confidence in its replicability. The primary risk is that the true effect is smaller than reported, but it is still likely to be detected in a replication.
---
0.72
The prediction is relatively high due to a large reported effect size (ηp² = .14) and a statistically significant p‑value (p ≈ .017, calculated from the F‑statistic). Supporting this, the study uses a straightforward ANOVA design within a cognitive paradigm, and the high author citation count suggests methodological expertise. However, the main source of uncertainty is the modest sample size (N=40), which can lead to an overestimation of the true effect size and slightly reduces confidence in a successful replication.
---
0.75
The study reports a large effect size (ηp² = .14) for a core cognitive psychology paradigm, which is a strong predictor of replicability. However, the sample size (N=40) is relatively small and the p‑value (p≈.017, calculated from F) is not extremely low, which slightly tempers confidence. Overall, the large, clearly reported effect in a field with a moderate-to-high replication rate suggests a good chance of success."

A psychology study reported the following abstract:
Snakes are among the most common targets of fears and phobias. In visual detection tasks, adults detect their presence more rapidly than the presence of other kinds of visual stimuli. We report evidence that very young children share this attentional bias. In three experiments, preschool children and adults were asked to find a single target picture among an array of eight distractors. Both the children and the adults detected snakes more rapidly than three types of nonthreatening stimuli (flowers, frogs, and caterpillars). These results provide the first evidence of enhanced visual detection of evolutionarily relevant threat stimuli in young children.

Key details:
- Sample size: 48
- Analysis type (e.g. rm ANOVA, mixed ANOVA, regression, t‑test): between ANOVA
- Test statistic: F(1, 44) = 13.42
- Reported p‑value: <.01
- Effect size (e.g. Cohen’s d, r): __p^2 = . 23
- First author’s citation count: 563
- Subfield: Cognitive, Social

Note:
First consider the subfield—some areas (e.g., social or developmental psychology) have historically shown lower replication rates—then adjust that judgment based on the specific study’s sample size, p-value, effect size, method complexity, and author citation count.",0.82,0.85,0.82,0.82,0.82,0.826,"0.82
The study reports a very large effect size (ηp² = .23) and a highly significant p-value (p < .01), which are strong positive indicators for replication. Although the sample size of 48 is relatively small, this risk is mitigated by the strength of the reported signal and the use of a simple analysis in a well-controlled cognitive paradigm. Therefore, the finding that children show an attentional bias for snakes is likely to be robust.
---
0.85
The very strong p-value (p < .01) and large reported effect size (ηp² = .23) are the primary indicators of a robust and replicable effect. Although the sample size (N=48) is a limitation, this is partly offset by the study's use of a simple analysis (ANOVA) and a highly controlled visual-search paradigm, which is a classic design in cognitive psychology. The finding also extends a well-established effect, increasing its prior plausibility.
---
0.82
The prediction is high due to a combination of a very large reported effect size (ηp² = .23), a highly significant p-value (p<.01), and a straightforward analysis (ANOVA) on a well-established cognitive paradigm. While the sample size (N=48) is small, which introduces some uncertainty, the strength of the statistical evidence suggests the underlying effect is robust and likely to be found in a replication attempt. The plausibility of extending a known adult phenomenon to children further supports this conclusion.
---
0.82
This study has a high probability of replicating due to its very strong statistical signal, including a low p-value (p < .01) and a large effect size (ηp² = .23). While the small sample size (N=48) is a notable weakness that could mean the effect is overestimated, the signal is so robust and the experimental paradigm so standard that a replication is still very likely to find the effect. The moderately high author citation count also lends some credibility to the finding.

0.82
The study reports a very large effect size (ηp² = .23) and a strong p‑value (p < .01), which are primary predictors of replicability. Although the sample size is small, the visual detection task is a standard cognitive paradigm and the finding is a plausible extension of a known effect in adults. The simple ANOVA analysis further increases confidence, suggesting the result is robust and likely to replicate successfully."

This prediction is low due to the combination of a small sample size (N=56) and a p‑value (p=0.037) that is very close to the conventional .05 threshold, a pairing strongly associated with replication failures. Although the effect size is medium and the chi‑squared analysis is simple, the weak statistical evidence from a small sample suggests the original result may have been a false positive or an overestimation. The low author citation count further suggests a junior researcher, which can sometimes correlate with less robust findings.
---
0.32
This prediction is low primarily because the reported p-value of 0.037 is very close to the .05 significance threshold, a range known for lower replication rates, and the sample size of 56 is small, making the original result less stable. Although the experimental design appears simple to implement, a significant internal inconsistency between the reported test statistic (X^2=4.51) and the effect size (w=.338) further reduces confidence in the reliability of the finding. The study is likely underpowered, and its key statistical results appear to contain errors.
---
0.35
The small sample size (N=56) and the p‑value (p=0.037) being just below the conventional .05 threshold are strong indicators of a fragile finding with low statistical power. While the simple Chi‑squared analysis is a positive sign that reduces concerns about analytic flexibility, this is overshadowed by the weak statistical evidence. The reported effect size is likely inflated, and an independent replication would have a low probability of success without a much larger sample.

0.32
The prediction is low primarily due to the combination of a small sample size (N=56) and a p‑value (p=0.037) that is just below the conventional significance threshold of .05. This pattern suggests the finding may be fragile and not robust enough to withstand sampling variation in a new study. While the reported medium effect size and simple chi-squared analysis are positive factors, the weak statistical evidence from an underpowered study substantially lowers the overall confidence in a successful replication.
---
0.32
The prediction is low due to the combination of a small sample size (N=56) and a p‑value (p=.037) that barely meets the conventional threshold for significance. This pattern suggests the study was likely underpowered, which increases the chance that the result is a false positive or that the medium effect size is an overestimation that would be difficult to detect again. The social psychology component of the study also contributes to this lower estimate, as the subfield has historically had lower replication rates."

The primary concern is the very small sample size (N=18), which makes the finding susceptible to high sampling error and effect size inflation. Although the reported p‑value is strong (p≈.007, calculated from F) and the effect size is massive, such extreme results from small samples are often unstable and shrink dramatically in replications. The within-subjects design is a strength, but the high risk of an overestimated effect lowers confidence in a successful replication.

The prediction is primarily based on the strong p-value (p≈.007, derived from the F-statistic), which suggests a robust effect is present. This confidence is tempered by the very small sample size (N=18), which can lead to overestimated effect sizes, but is bolstered by the report of three successful experiments in the abstract. The straightforward cognitive paradigm with a within-subjects design also supports a positive prediction.

The primary reasons for predicting a low replication probability are the very small sample size (N=18) and the extremely large, and likely inflated, reported effect size. Such a combination is a classic indicator of a ""winner's curse,"" where an initial study finds a spuriously large effect that is unlikely to be reproduced in a replication with a larger, more representative sample. Although the p-value is low and the analysis is standard, these factors are insufficient to overcome the high risk of a false positive or substantially overestimated effect associated with such low statistical power.

The primary concern for replication is the extremely small sample size (N=18), which makes the finding susceptible to sampling error and leads to a likely inflated effect size estimate. While the p-value is strong (the reported `prep` corresponds to p≈.008) and the author is established, the massive reported effect size is a classic warning sign of the ""winner's curse."" The combination of a tiny sample and a huge effect dramatically lowers confidence in a successful replication, despite the straightforward analysis.

The primary concerns are the very small sample size (N=18) and the extremely large reported effect size (η²=.7), a combination that suggests the result is likely inflated by sampling error. Although the p-value is strong and the cognitive paradigm is plausible, such an underpowered study is highly susceptible to finding a spurious or exaggerated effect. A well-powered replication would likely find a much smaller effect, if any, and thus has a lower probability of achieving statistical significance."
