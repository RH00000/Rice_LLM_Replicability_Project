Also, when a study reports a p-value as < .05, it is often closer to 0.049 than to 0.001. Such borderline significance is more likely to reflect an overestimated effect size.

These three phenomena, it can be argued, tap into different aspects of inhibition. Monolinguals and bilinguals did not differ in stop signal reaction time and thus were comparable in terms of active-inhibitory efficiency. However, bilinguals showed no facilitation from spatial cues, showed a strong inhibition of return effect, and exhibited a more pronounced attentional blink.

It has been claimed that bilingualism enhances inhibitory control, but the available evidence is equivocal. The authors evaluated several possible versions of the inhibition hypothesis by comparing monolinguals and bilinguals with regard to stop signal performance, inhibition of return, and the attentional blink. These three phenomena, it can be argued, tap into different aspects of inhibition. Monolinguals and bilinguals did not differ in stop signal reaction time and thus were comparable in terms of active-inhibitory efficiency. However, bilinguals showed no facilitation from spatial cues, showed a strong inhibition of return effect, and exhibited a more pronounced attentional blink. These results suggest that bilinguals do not differ from monolinguals in terms of active inhibition but have acquired a better ability to maintain action goals and to use them to bias goal-related information.

Participants were presented with digits spaced irregularly in time and postcued (Experiments 1 and 2) or precued (Experiment 3) to recall the order or timing of the digits. The primary results of interest were as follows: (a) Instructing participants to group lists had similar effects on serial and timing recall in inducing a pause in recall between suggested groups; (b) the timing of recall was predicted by the timing of the input lists in both serial recall and timing recall; and (c) when the recall task was precued, there was a tendency for temporally isolated items to be more accurately recalled than temporally crowded items. The results place constraints on models of serial recall that assume a timing signal generates positional representations and suggest an additional role for information about individual durations in short-term memory.

The original study had a sample size of 40, used paired sample t-test type of analysis, had a test statistic of t(39) = 3.77, and reported a p-value of 0.001 with an effect size of d=0.6. The result tested a main effect.

Note: Studies with small sample sizes are more vulnerable to sampling error and tend to have lower replication success rates. Also, when a study reports a p-value as < .05, it is often closer to 0.049 than to 0.001. Such borderline significance is more likely to reflect an overestimated effect size.

34,Complement coercion is not modulated by competition: Evidence from eye movements.,"S Frisson, B McElree",F<.01,"""not significant""",ANOVA,interaction,X,40,,,,,,"An eye-movement study examined the processing of expressions requiring complement coercion (J. Pustejovsky, 1995), in which a noun phrase that does not denote an event (e.g., the book) appears as the complement of an event-selecting verb (e.g., began the book). Previous studies demonstrated that these expressions are more costly to process than are control expressions that can be processed with basic compositional operations (L. Pylkkanen & B. McElree, 2006). Complement coercion is thought to be costly because comprehenders need to construct an event sense of the complement to satisfy the semantic restrictions of the verb (e.g., began writing the book). The reported experiment tests the alternative hypotheses that the cost arises from the need to select 1 interpretation from several or from competition between alternative interpretations. Expressions with weakly constrained interpretations (no dominant interpretation and several alternative interpretations) were not more costly to process than expressions with a strongly constrained interpretation (1 dominant interpretation and few alternative interpretations).

The core finding is supported by ""7 studies"" using diverse methods, which strongly suggests robustness and internal replication, but the lack of reported statistical details (sample size, p-value, effect size) for the overall result and the presence of a less reliably replicating interaction effect (gender moderation) reduce the overall confidence."

The original study had a sample size of 251, used Pearson's Chi-squared test type of analysis, had a test statistic of X^2(1, N=251) = 3.16, and reported a p-value of 0.07 with an effect size of nan. The result tested a interaction.

Note: Studies with small sample sizes are more vulnerable to sampling error and tend to have lower replication success rates. Also, when a study reports a p-value as < .05, it is often closer to 0.049 than to 0.001. Such borderline significance is more likely to reflect an overestimated effect size. Interaction effects also tend to replicate less reliably than main effects.

Proportion = 0.78,211,X,333,0.05,yes,1,"The present research tests whether recognition for the nonverbal expression of pride generalizes across cultures. Study 1 provided the first evidence for cross-cultural recognition of pride, demonstrating that the expression generalizes across Italy and the United States. Study 2 found that the pride expression generalizes beyond Western cultures; individuals from a preliterate, highly isolated tribe in Burkina Faso, West Africa, reliably recognized pride, regardless of whether it was displayed by African or American targets. These Burkinabe participants were unlikely to have learned the pride expression through cross-cultural transmission, so their recognition suggests that pride may be a human universal. Studies 3 and 4 used drawn figures to systematically manipulate the ethnicity and gender of targets showing the expression, and demonstrated that pride recognition generalizes across male and female targets of African, Asian, and Caucasian descent. Discussion focuses on the implications of the findings for the universality of the pride expression.","A psychology study reported the following abstract:
